# How to create an Apache Spark job definition in Fabric

In this tutorial, learn how to create a Spark job definition in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following prerequisites:

- A [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../placeholder.md).
- Access to the Data Engineering Workload. [Onboard onto the data engineering workload](../placeholder.md).

> [!TIP]
> To run the Spark job definition item, main definition file and default lakehouse context are required. If you don't have a lakehouse, you can create one by following the steps in [Create a lakehouse](../data-engineering/create-lakehouse.md).


## Create a Spark job definition

The Spark job definition creation process is quick and simple and there are several ways to get started.

### Options to create a Spark job definition

There are a few ways you can get started with the creation process:

- **Data engineering homepage**: You can easily create a Spark job definition through the **Spark job definition** card under the **New** section in the homepage.

- **Workspace view**: You can also create a Spark job definition through the **Workspace** view when you are on the **Data Engineering** workload by using the **New** dropdown.

:::image type="content" source="media\create-spark-job-definition\data-engineering-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Spark job definition in the New menu." lightbox="media\create-spark-job-definition\data-engineering-new.png":::

- **Create Hub**: Another entry point to create a Spark job definition is in the **Create Hub** page under **Data Engineering**.

:::image type="content" source="media\create-spark-job-definition\create-hub-data-engineering.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Spark job definition on the Create Hub." lightbox="media\create-spark-job-definition\create-hub-data-engineering.png":::

A name would be required to create a Spark job definition. The name must be unique within the current workspace. The newly created Spark Job definition will be created under the current workspace you are in.


### Create a Spark job definition for PySpark (Python)

To create a Spark job definition for PySpark, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Spark job definition.

2. Select **PySpark (Python)** from the **Language** dropdown.

3. Upload the main definition file as *.py* file. The main definition file is the file that contains the application logic of this *job.Main* definition file is mandatory to run a Spark job. For each Spark Job Definition, you can only upload one main definition file.
   
   Beside uploading from local desktop, you can also upload from existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 by providing the full abfss path of the file. For example, abfss://your-storage-account-name.dfs.core.windows.net/your-file- path. 

4. Upload Reference files as *.py* file. the Reference files are the python modules that are imported by the main definition file. Similar as uploading main definition file, you can also upload from existing Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 by providing the full abfss path of the file. Multiple reference files are supported.

> [!TIP]
> If ADLS-gen2 path is used, to make sure the file is accessible, The user account which is used to run the job should be assigned with proper permission to the storage account. There are two suggested way to do this:
>   - Assign the user account as Contributor role to the storage account.
>   - Grant Read and Execution permission to the user account on the file via Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Access Control List (ACL)
>  
> For manually run, the account of current login user would be used to run the job

5. Provide command line arguments to the job if needed. please use space as splitter to separate the arguments.

6. Add the lakehouse reference to the job. You must have at least one lakehouse reference added to the job. This lakehouse is the default lakehouse context for the job.
   Multiple lakehouse references are supported. For the non-default Lakehouse, you can find its name and full OneLake URL in the Spark Settings page.

   :::image type="content" source="media\create-spark-job-definition\main-definition-file-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example of a populated main definition file screen." lightbox="media\create-spark-job-definition\main-definition-file-example.png":::

In this example, we've done the following:

- Created a Spark job definition named **CSVToDelta** for PySpark
- Uploaded the *createTablefromCSV.py* file as the main definition file
- Added the lakehouse references *LH001* and *LH002* to the job
- Made *LH001* the default lakehouse context

### Create a Spark job definition for Scala/Java

To create a Spark job definition for Scala/Java, follow these steps:

1. Select **Spark(Scala/Java)** from the **Language** dropdown.

1. Upload the main definition file as .jar file. The main definition file is the file that contains the application logic of this job. A main definition file is mandatory to run a Spark Job. Provide the Main class name.

1. Upload Reference files as .jar file. the Reference files are the files that are referenced/imported by the main definition file.

1. Provides command line arguments to the job if needed.

1. Add the lakehouse reference to the job. You must have at least one lakehouse reference added to the job. This lakehouse is the default lakehouse context for the job.

### Create a Spark job definition for R

To create a Spark job definition for SparkR(R), follow these steps:

1. Select **SparkR(R)** from the **Language** dropdown.

2. Upload the main definition file as .R file. The main definition file is the file that contains the application logic of this job. A main definition file is mandatory to run a Spark Job. 

3. Upload Reference files as .R file. the Reference files are the files that are referenced/imported by the main definition file.

4. Provides command line arguments to the job if needed.

5. Add the lakehouse reference to the job. You must have at least one lakehouse reference added to the job. This lakehouse is the default lakehouse context for the job.

> [!NOTE]
> The Spark job definition will be created under the current workspace you are in.

### Options to customize Spark job definition

There are a few options to further customize the execution of Spark job definition

- **Spark Compute**: Within the **Spark Compute** tab, you can see the Runtime Version which is the version of Spark that will be used to run the job. You can also see the Spark configuration settings that will be used to run the job. You can customize the Spark configuration settings by clicking on the **Add** button.

 :::image type="content" source="media\create-spark-job-definition\spark-compute.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to edit Spark configuration." lightbox="media\create-spark-job-definition\spark-compute.png":::

- **Optimization**: Within the **Optimization** tab, you can enable and set up the Retry Policy for the job. When enabled, the job will be retried if it fails. You can also set the maximum number of retries and the interval between retries. For each attempt of retry, the job will be restarted, please make sure the job is idempotent.
