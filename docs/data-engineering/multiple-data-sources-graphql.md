# Query multiple data sources in Fabric API for GraphQL

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Fabric API for GraphQL is in preview.

In Fabric API for GraphQL, you can expose many data sources through a single API item. This feature allows you to issue a single query that retrieves data across multiple data sources.

> [!NOTE]
> A multi-data source request fans out individual requests to data sources. You cannot create relationships across types that span multiple data sources.

## Query example

The following example shows a query that spans across both the **AdventureWorks** and the **testsqldb2** data sources:

This functionality can enhance the performance of your applications by reducing the number of round trips between your application and the API for GraphQL.
