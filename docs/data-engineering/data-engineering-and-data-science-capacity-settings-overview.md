# Data engineering/science capacity administration settings

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Admins purchase [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] capacities based on the compute and scale requirements  of their enterprise's analytics requirements. Admins being responsible for the spend management and also for governance, it becomes essential that they are able to govern and manage the compute properties for data engineering/science analytics applications. 
[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] capacity admins can now manage and govern their Data Engineering/Science settings based from the admin settings portal. Admins can configure Spark environment  for their data engineers/scientists by enabling workspace level compute, select  default runtime and also create or manage spark properties for their capacities.

Admins can select a specific capacity and navigate to the Data Engineering/Science section in the Admin portal page of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].
