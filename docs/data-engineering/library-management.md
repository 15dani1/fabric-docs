# Manage Apache Spark libraries in Microsoft Fabric

A library is a collection of prewritten code that developers can import to provide functionality. By using libraries, you can save time and effort by not having to write code from scratch to do common tasks. Instead, import the library and use its functions and classes to achieve the desired functionality. Microsoft Fabric provides multiple mechanisms to help you manage and use libraries.

- **Built-in libraries**: Each Fabric Spark runtime provides a rich set of popular preinstalled libraries. You can find the full built-in library list in [Fabric Spark Runtime](runtime.md).
- **Public libraries**: Public libraries are sourced from repositories such as PyPI and Conda, which are currently supported.
- **Custom libraries**: Custom libraries refer to code that you or your organization build. Fabric supports them in the *.whl*, *.jar*, and *.tar.gz* formats. Fabric supports *.tar.gz* only for the R language. For Python custom libraries, use the *.whl* format.

## Library management in workspace setting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Library management at the workspace setting is no longer supported. To migrate to an environment and attach as workspace default, see [Migrate the workspace libraries and Spark properties](environment-workspace-migration.md).

## Summary of library management best practices

The following scenarios describe best practices.

### Scenario 1: Admin sets default libraries for the workspace

In order to set default libraries, you have to be the administrator of the workspace.

- [Create a new environment](create-and-use-environment.md#create-an-environment)
- [Install the required libraries](environment-manage-library.md)
- [Attach this environment as workspace default](create-and-use-environment.md#attach-an-environment-as-workspace-default)

The notebooks and Spark job definitions in the workspace are attached to the **Workspace settings**. They start sessions with the libraries installed in the workspace's default environment.

### Scenario 2: Persist library specifications for one or multiple code items

If you want to persist the library specifications, [install the libraries in an environment](environment-manage-library.md) and [attach it to the code items](create-and-use-environment.md#attach-an-environment-to-a-notebook-or-a-spark-job-definition).

One benefit of this approach is that it saves effort of running the code that requires common libraries all the time. Once successfully installed in the environment, the libraries are effective in all Spark sessions if the environment is attached.

Another benefit is that the approach supports library configuration granularity lower than the workspace level. One environment can be attached to multiple code artifacts. If you have a subset of notebooks or Spark job definitions in one workspace that require the same libraries, attach them to the same environment. An administrator, member, or contributor of the workspace can create, edit, and attach the environment.

### Scenario 3: Inline installation in interactive run

If you want to use a library that isn't installed for one-time use in an interactive notebook run, [inline installation](#inline-installation) is the most convenient option. Inline commands in Fabric allow you to have the library effective in the current notebook Spark session. It doesn't persist across different sessions.

Users who have the permission to run the notebook, can install other libraries in the Spark session.

## Summary of supported library types

| **Library type** | **Environment library management** | **Inline installation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Python Public (PyPI & Conda)** | Supported | Supported |
| **Python Custom (.whl)** | Supported | Supported |
| **R Public (CRAN)** | Not supported | Supported |
| **R custom (.tar.gz)** | Supported | Supported |
| **Jar** | Supported as custom library | Not supported |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are currently limitations on the *.jar* library.
>
> - For Scala users, the *.jar* file can install successfully in an environment but it isn't effective for your Spark/Scala sessions. The installation overrides the built-in library with a different library. The new *.jar* works in the sessions.
> - For Python users, all *.jar* files are currently not supported in an environment. They can install successfully in an environment but aren't effective in PySpark sessions.
> - You can install the *.jar* files at the notebook [session level](#manage-jar-libraries-through-inline-installation) instead.

## Inline installation

Inline commands support Python libraries and R libraries.

<a id="python-in-line-installation"></a>
### Python inline installation

The Python interpreter restarts to apply the change of libraries. Any variables defined before you run the command cell are lost. We strongly recommend you to put all the commands for adding, deleting, or updating Python packages at the beginning of your notebook.

We recommend `%pip` instead of `!pip`. `!pip` is an IPython built-in shell command, which has the following limitations:

- `!pip` only installs a package on the driver node, not executor nodes.
- Packages that install through `!pip` don't affect conflicts with built-in packages or whether packages are already imported in a notebook.

However, `%pip` handles these scenarios. Libraries installed through `%pip` are available on both driver and executor nodes and are still effective even it's already imported.

> [!TIP]
>
> The `%conda install` command usually takes longer than the `%pip install` command to install new Python libraries. It checks the full dependencies and resolves conflicts.
>
> You might want to use `%conda install` for more reliability and stability. You can use `%pip install` if you are sure that the library you want to install doesn't conflict with the preinstalled libraries in the runtime environment.

For all available Python inline commands and clarifications, see [%pip commands](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/) and [%conda commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html).

#### Manage Python public libraries through inline installation

In this example, see how to use inline commands to manage libraries. Suppose you want to use *altair*, a powerful visualization library for Python, for a one-time data exploration. Suppose the library isn't installed in your workspace. The following example uses conda commands to illustrate the steps.

You can use inline commands to enable *altair* on your notebook session without affecting other sessions of the notebook or other items.

1. Run the following commands in a notebook code cell. The first command installs the *altair* library. Also, install *vega_datasets*, which contains a semantic model you can use to visualize.

   ```python
   %conda install altair          # install latest version through conda command
   %conda install vega_datasets   # install latest version through conda command
   ```

   The output of the cell indicates the result of the installation.

2. Import the package and semantic model by running the following code in another notebook cell.

   ```python
   import altair as alt
   from vega_datasets import data
   ```

3. Now you can play around with the session-scoped *altair* library.

   ```python
   # load a simple dataset as a pandas DataFrame
   cars = data.cars()
   alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
   x='Horsepower',
   y='Miles_per_Gallon',
   color='Origin',
   ).interactive()
   ```

#### Manage Python custom libraries through inline installation

You can upload your Python custom libraries to the *File* folder of the lakehouse attached to your notebook. Go to your lakehouse, select the **â€¦** icon on the **File** folder, and upload the custom library.

After your upload, use the following command to install the custom library to your notebook session:

```python
# install the .whl through pip command
%pip install /lakehouse/default/Files/wheel_file_name.whl             
```

### R inline installation

To manage R libraries, Fabric supports the `install.packages()`, `remove.packages()`, and `devtools::` commands. For all available R inline commands and clarifications, see [install.packages command](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/install.packages.html) and [remove.package command](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/remove.packages.html).

#### Manage R public libraries through inline installation

Follow this example to walk through the steps of installing an R public library.

To install an R feed library:

1. Switch the working language to **SparkR (R)** in the notebook ribbon.

2. Install the *caesar* library by running the following command in a notebook cell.

   ```python
   install.packages("caesar")
   ```

3. Now you can play around with the session-scoped *caesar* library with a Spark job.

   ```python
   library(SparkR)
   sparkR.session()

   hello <- function(x) {
   library(caesar)
   caesar(x)
   }
   spark.lapply(c("hello world", "good morning", "good evening"), hello)
   ```

### Manage Jar libraries through inline installation

The *.jar* files are supported at notebook sessions with following code.

```Scala
// Using notebook built-in folder as an example
%%configure -f: 
{
    "conf": {
        "spark.jars": "{mssparkutils.nbResPath}/builtin/jar_file_name.jar"
    }
}       
```
