# What is the admin monitoring workspace?

The Admin monitoring workspace is designed to provide admins with monitoring capabilities for their organization.

## Prerequisites

Verify that the [new workspace experience](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal-workspace#create-workspaces-new-workspace-experience) is enabled.

## Access the admin monitoring workspace

The Admin monitoring workspace is enabled for Microsoft Fabric admins. Admins can also share its content with other users.

The admin monitoring workspace is automatically installed during the first time you access it. To access the admin monitoring workspace, follow these steps:

1. Log into Microsoft Fabric with your account.

2. From the left pane, select **Workspaces**.

3. Select **Admin monitoring**. When you select this option for the first time, the required items are automatically installed.

## Reports and datasets

In the monitoring workspace, you can use the [Feature Usage and Adoption](/power-bi/developer/visuals/create-r-based-power-bi-desktop) report as is. You can also connect to this report's dataset, and create a solution that's optimized for your organization.
