# Manage capacity settings

Capacity is a dedicated set of resources reserved for exclusive use. Premium and Embedded capacities offer a dependable and consistent performance for your content. Here are some settings that you can configure when managing your organization's capacity settings:

* Create new capacities
* Delete capacities
* Manage capacity permissions
* Change the size of the capacity
