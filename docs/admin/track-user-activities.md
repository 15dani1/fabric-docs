# Track user activities in Fabric

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Knowing who is taking what action on which item in Fabric can be critical in helping your organization fulfill its requirements, such as meeting regulatory compliance and records management.

In Fabric, user activities are logged in the Power BI activity log and in the unified audit log. You can retrieve them for tracking purposes in the same way as in Power BI, as described in [Track user activities in Power BI](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-auditing). The following operations can be retrieved:

* For Power BI items: All currently available operations

* For all other Fabric items: Currently, only *create*, *read*, *update*, and *delete* operations.
