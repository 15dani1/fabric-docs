# What is the admin portal?

The Microsoft Fabric admin portal includes settings that govern Microsoft Fabric. For example, you can make changes to [tenant settings](tenant-settings-index.md), access the Microsoft 365 admin portal, and control how users interact with Microsoft Fabric.

To access the admin portal you need a [Fabric license](../enterprise/licenses.md#per-user-licenses). The admin portal can be accessed by admins with the following roles:

* Global administrator

* Power Platform administrator

* Fabric administrator

If you're not in one of these roles, you only see *Capacity settings* in the admin portal.
