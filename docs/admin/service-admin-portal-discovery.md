# Discovery tenant settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings).

[Discoverability](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) is a feature that dataset owners can use to make their endorsed content discoverable by users who don't yet have access to it. See [Discoverability](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) for more detail.
