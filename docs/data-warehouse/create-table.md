# Create tables in Synapse Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-se](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Have access to a [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] within a premium per capacity workspace with contributor or above permissions.
- Choose your query tool. This tutorial displays the SQL query editor in the fabric portal and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), but you can use any T-SQL querying tool.
    - [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (use the latest version available).
    - [Download Azure Data Studio](https://aka.ms/azuredatastudio).
    - Use the [SQL query editor in the Fabric portal](sql-query-editor.md).

For more information on connecting to your [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], see [Connectivity](connectivity.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> For complete syntax, refer to [CREATE TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric#DataTypes&preserve-view=true).

### Create a new table in the SQL query editor in the Fabric portal
In the ribbon, create a new query using the **New SQL Query** button. If you click the dropdown, you can easily create T-SQL objects with code templates. After clicking **Table**, you will notice an autogenerated [CREATE TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric#DataTypes&preserve-view=true) script prepopulated in your SQL query window, as shown in the following image below.

### Create a new table in SQL Server Management Studio

1. In SSMS, locate the [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] in the **Object Explorer** and right-click to select **New Query**. This opens a tab to write a new query.

1. A new tab appears for you to write your CREATE TABLE SQL query.

1. Refer to syntax of [CREATE TABLE](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true). For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE myTable
  (  
    id int NOT NULL,  
    lastName varchar(20),  
    zipCode varchar(6)  
  );  
```

## Known limitations

See [T-SQL surface area](warehouse.md#t-sql-surface-area) for a list of T-SQL commands that are currently not available.
