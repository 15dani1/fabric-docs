This functionality isn't supported for a default warehouse, you can only rename the **warehouse** item.

From within the **Settings**, select the Settings icon in the ribbon. The **Settings** panel displays on the right side of the screen; you can edit the name of the warehouse to provide a new name and close the panel.

You can also get to the **Settings** panel from the more menu (**...**), next to the warehouse name in the workspace view.
