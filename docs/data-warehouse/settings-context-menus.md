# Warehouse settings and context menus

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Settings are accessible from the context menu or from the Settings icon in the ribbon when you open the item. There are some key differences in the actions you can take in settings depending on if you're interacting with the SQL Endpoint or a data warehouse.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Settings options

This section describes and explains the settings options available based on the item you're working with and its description.

The following image shows the warehouse settings menu.

## Context menus

*Applies to:* [!INCLUDE[fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

Warehouse offers an easy experience to create reports and access supported actions using its context menus.

:::image type="content" source="media\settings-context-menus\warehouse-context-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the warehouse context menu." lightbox="media\settings-context-menus\warehouse-context-menu.png":::

The following table describes the warehouse context menu options:

| **Menu option** | **Option description** |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Opens warehouse to explore and analyze data. |
| **Open with** | Opens warehouse in Azure Data Studio. |
| **Share** | Lets users share the warehouse to build content based on the underlying default Power BI dataset, query data using SQL or get access to underlying data files. Shares the warehouse access (SQL- connect only, and autogenerated dataset) with other users in your organization. Users receive an email with links to access the detail page where they can find the SQL connection string and can access the default dataset to create reports based on it. |
| **Analyze in Excel** | Uses the existing Analyze in Excel capability on default Power BI dataset. Learn more: [Analyze in Excel](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-analyze-in-excel). |
| **Create report** | Build a report in DirectQuery mode. Learn more: [Get started creating in the Power BI service](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-get-started) |
| **Rename** | Updates the warehouse with the new name. Does not apply to (Lakehouse) SQL endpoint. |
| **Delete** | Delete warehouse from workspace. A confirmation dialog notifies you of the impact of the delete action. If the Delete action is confirmed, then the warehouse and related downstream items are deleted. Does not apply to (Lakehouse) SQL endpoint |
| **Manage permissions** | Enables users to add other recipients with specified permissions, similar to allowing the sharing of an underlying dataset or allowing to build content with the data associated with the underlying dataset. |
| **Settings** | Learn more about warehouse settings in the previous section. |
| **View lineage** | This option shows the end-to-end lineage of warehouse from the data sources to the warehouse, the default Power BI dataset, and other datasets (if any) that were built on top of the warehouse, all the way to deports, dashboards and apps. |
| **View details** | Opens up warehouse details in Data hub. |
