# Creating reports

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

**Applies to:** Warehouse and SQL Endpoint

Warehouse lets you create reusable and default datasets to create reports in various ways in Power BI. This article describes the various ways you can use your warehouses, and their default datasets, to create reports.

For example, you can establish a live connection to a shared dataset in the Power BI service and create many different reports from the same dataset. You can create your perfect data model in Power BI Desktop and publish it to the Power BI service. Then you and others can create multiple reports in separate .pbix files from that common data model and save them to different workspaces.

Advanced users can build reports from a warehouse using a composite model or using the SQL Endpoint.

Reports that use warehouse can currently be created with the the Power BI service. Let's take a look at how warehouse can be used with this tool: [Create reports in the Power BI service](reports-power-bi-service.md).
