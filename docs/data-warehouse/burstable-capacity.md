# Burstable Capacity in Fabric data warehousing

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Burstable Capacity
A Fabric capacity is a distinct pool of resources thatâ€™s size (or SKU) determines the amount of computational power available. [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] and [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] provide burstable capacity that allows workloads to use more resources to achieve better performance.

Burstable capacity has a direct correlation to the SKU that has been assigned to the Fabric capacity of the workspace. It also is a function of the workload. A nondemanding workload might never use burstable capacity units. The workload could achieve optimal performance within the baseline capacity that has been purchased. To determine if your workload is using burstable capacity, the following formula can be used to calculate the scale factor for your workload.
`Capacity Units (CU)    / duration / Baseline CU = scale factor`

CU can be determined by using the [capacity metrics app](usage-reporting.md)

As an illustration of this formula, if your capacity is an F8, and your workload takes 100 seconds to complete, and it uses 1500 CUs, the scale factor would be calculated as follows:
`1500 / 100 / 8 = 1.875`

When a scale factor is over 1, it means that burstable capacity is being used to meet the demands of the workload. It also means that your workload is borrowing capacity units from a future time interval. This is a fundamental concept of Microsoft Fabric called [smoothing](compute-capacity-smoothing-throttling.md#smoothing).

## SKU Guardrails
Burstable capacity isn't infinite. There's a limit that is applied to the backend compute resources to greatly reduce the risk of [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] and [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] workloads from exclusively causing [throttling](compute-capacity-smoothing-throttling.md#throttling)

The limit (or guardrail) is a scale factor directly correlated to the Fabric Capacity SKU size that is assigned to the workspace.

Smaller  SKU sizes are often used for Dev/Test scenarios or ad-hoc workloads. The larger scale factor shown in the table gives more processing power that aligns with lower overall utilization typically found in those environments.

Larger SKU sizes have access to more total capacity units, allowing for more complex workloads to run optimally.

> [!NOTE]
> The max burstable scale factor in the above table may only be observable for extremely small time intervals. Often within a single query for seconds or even milliseconds. When using the capacity metrics app to observe burstable capacity note that the scale factor over longer durations will be much lower.

## Isolation Boundaries
As described in the [workload management](workload-management.md#ingestion-isolation) documentation, [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)] fully isolates ingestion from query processing. The burstable scale factor can be achieved independently for ingestion at the same time the burstable scale factor is achieved for query processing. These scale factors encapsulate all processes within a single workspace. However, capacity can be assigned to multiple workspaces. Therefore, the aggregate max scale factor across a capacity would be represented in the following formula.
`([query burstable scale factor] + [ingestion burstable scale factor]) * [Number of workspaces] = [aggregate burstable scale factor]`

## Troubleshooting
Typically, a complex query running in a workspace assigned to a small capacity SKU size should run to completion. However, if the data retrieval or intermediate data processing physically can't run within the burstable scale factor, it results in the following error message: `this query was rejected due to current capacity constraints.`

This message indicates that the capacity SKU size is too small to perform the query processing activity. To increase the SKU size, contact your capacity administrator.

After the [capacity is resized](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/scale-capacity), the new guardrails will be applied at the time the next query is run. Performance should stabilize to the new capacity SKU size within a few seconds of the first query submission.

Also, a workload running on a nonoptimal capacity size can be subject to resource contention (such as spilling) that can increase the CU usage of the workload.
