# Create a measure

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

A [measure](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-measures) is a collection of standardized metrics. Similar to Power BI Desktop, the DAX editing experience in warehouse presents a rich editor complete with auto-complete for formulas (IntelliSense). The DAX editor enables you to easily develop measures right in warehouse, making it a more effective single source for business logic, semantics, and business critical calculations.

## How to create a measure

*Applies to:* Warehouse (default) and warehouse

To create a measure, select the table in the **Table Explorer** and select the **New Measure** button in the ribbon, as shown in the following image.

Enter the measure into the formula bar and specify the table and the column to which it applies. The formula bar lets you enter your measure.

You can expand the table to find the measure in the table.
