A [measure](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-measures) is a collection of standardized metrics. Similar to Power BI Desktop, the DAX editing experience in warehouse presents a rich editor complete with auto-complete for formulas (IntelliSense). The DAX editor enables you to easily develop measures right in warehouse, making it a more effective single source for business logic, semantics, and business critical calculations.

## How to create a measure
