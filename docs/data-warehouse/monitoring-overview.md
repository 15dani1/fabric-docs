# Monitor in Fabric Data warehouse overview

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-se-and-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

Monitoring the usage and activity is crucial for ensuring that the data warehouse operates efficiently. Fabric provides a set of tools to help you optimize your query performance, gain insights into your Fabric capacity to determine when itâ€™s time to scale up or down, and understand details about running and completed queries including when it was executed and who is the user running the query.  

## Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app: 
- The Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app provides visibility into capacity usage of each warehouse allowing you to see the compute charges for all user-generated and system-generated T-SQL statements within a Warehouse and SQL Analytics Endpoint. Refer to [Billing and utilization reporting in Synapse Data Warehouse](usage-reporting.md) for more information. 

## DMVs: 
- Users can get insights about their live connections, sessions and requests using a set of Dynamic Management Views (DMVs). Refer to [Monitor connections, sessions, and requests using DMVs](query-activity.md) for more information.

## Query insights: 
- Query Insights provides historical query data for completed, failed, canceled queries along with aggregated insights to help you tune your query performance. Refer to [Query insights in Fabric data warehousing](query-insights.md) for more information.

## Query activity: 
- Users are provided a one-stop view of their running and completed queries in an easy-to-use interface without having to run T-SQL. Refer to [Monitor your running and completed queries using Query activity](query-activity.md) for more information.
