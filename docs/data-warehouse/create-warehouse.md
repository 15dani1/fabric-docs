## How to create a warehouse

*Applies to:* Warehouse

In this section, we walk you through three distinct experiences available for creating a warehouse from scratch in the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] portal.

### Create a warehouse using the Home hub

The first hub in the left navigation menus is the **Home** hub. You can start creating your warehouse from the **Home** hub by selecting the **Warehouse** card under the **New** section. An empty warehouse is created for you to start creating objects in the warehouse. You can use either a [sample data set](/azure/open-datasets/dataset-catalog) to get a jump start or load your own test data if you prefer.

### Create a warehouse using the Create hub

Another option available to create your warehouse is through the Create hub, which is the second hub in the left navigation menu.

You can create your warehouse from the Create hub by selecting the **Warehouse** card under the **Data Warehousing** section. When you select the card, an empty warehouse is created for you to start creating objects in the warehouse or use a sample to get started as previously mentioned.

It usually takes approximately 10 seconds to provision a new warehouse. Once initialized, you can load data into your warehouse. For more information about getting data into a warehouse, see [Get and transform data](../placeholder.md).
