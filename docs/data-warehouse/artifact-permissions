There are two ways that the artifact permissions can be assigned:
- Sharing - <note: need to link to sharing page>
- Manage permissions - <note: need to link to manage permissions page>

 
For [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] and [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)], the following permisions can be assigned.
