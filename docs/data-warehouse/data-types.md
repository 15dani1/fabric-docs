# Data types in Microsoft Fabric

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[fabric-se-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-se-and-dw.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Tables in Microsoft Fabric support the most commonly used T-SQL data types. 

- For more information on table creation, see [Tables](tables.md).

## Data types in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)]

For a list of the supported data types in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)], see [data types in CREATE TABLE reference](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse?view=fabric&preserve-view=true#DataTypesFabric). 

For a guide to create a table in [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/fabric-dw.md)], see [Create tables](create-table.md).

## Autogenerated data types in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)]

The column types in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)] of the Lakehouse are derived from the source Delta types.

| **Delta Data Type** | **SQL Data** **Type (Mapped)** |
|---|---|
| **Long &#124;** **BIGINT** | bigint |
| **BOOLEAN &#124;** **BOOL** | bit |
| **INT &#124; INTEGER** | int |
| **TINYINT &#124; BYTE &#124;** **SMALLINT &#124; SHORT** | smallint |
| **DOUBLE** | float |
| **FLOAT &#124; REAL** | real |
| **DATE** | date |
| **TIMESTAMP** | datetime2 |
| **CHAR(n)** | varchar(n) with `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` collation. |
| **STRING &#124; VARCHAR(n)** | varchar(n) with `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` collation. STRING/VARCHAR(MAX) is mapped to varchar(8000). |
| **BINARY** | varbinary(n). |
| **DECIMAL &#124; DEC &#124; NUMERIC** | decimal(p,s) |

The columns that have the types that aren't listed in the table aren't represented as the table columns in the [!INCLUDE [fabric-se](includes/fabric-se.md)].
