# How to: Use Copilot code completion for Synapse Data Warehouse

**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE [fabric-dw](includes/applies-to-version/fabric-dw.md)]

Copilot for Data Warehouse provides intelligent autocomplete-style code suggestions to simplify your coding experience. As you start writing T-SQL code or comments in the editor, Copilot for Data Warehouse leverages your warehouse schema and query tab context to complement the existing IntelliSense with inline code suggestions. The completions can come in varied lengths - sometimes the completion of the current line, and sometimes a whole new block of code. The code completions support all types of queries -- DQL, DML, and DDL. You can accept all or part of a suggestion or keep typing to ignore the suggestions. It can also generate alternative suggestions for you to pick.

## Prerequisites
