# Monitoring connections, sessions, and requests using DMVs

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

**Applies to:** Warehouse and SQL Endpoint

For the current version, there are three Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) provided for you to receive live SQL query lifecycle insights.

- Sys.dm_exec_connections
- Sys.dm_exec_sessions
- Sys.dm_exec_requests

These three DMVs provide detailed insight on the following scenarios:

- Who is the user running the session?
- When was the session started by the user?
- Whatâ€™s the ID of the connection to the data warehouse item and the session that is running the request?
- How many queries are actively running?
- Which queries are long running?

## Sys.dm_exec_connections (Transact-SQL)

Returns information about each connection established between the warehouse and the engine.

## How to monitor connections, sessions, and requests using Query Lifecycle DMVs

In this tutorial, learn how to monitor your running SQL queries using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs).

### Example DMV queries

The following example queries sys.dm_exec_sessions to find all sessions that are currently executing.

```
SELECT * 
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions;
```

### Find the relationship between connections and sessions

The following example joins sys.dm_exec_connections and sys.dm_exec_sessions to the relationship between the active session in a specific connection.

```
SELECT connections.connection_id,
 connections.connect_time,
 sessions.session_id, sessions.login_name, sessions.login_time, sessions.status
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections connections
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions sessions
ON connections.session_id=sessions.session_id
```

### Identify and KILL a long-running query

This first query identifies the list of long-running queries in the order of which query has taken the longest since it has arrived.

```
 SELECT request_id, session_id, start_time, total_elapsed_time,
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE status = â€˜runningâ€™
ORDER BY total_elapsed_time DESC
```

This second query shows which user ran the session that has the long-running query.

```
SELECT login_name,
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE â€˜session_idâ€™ = â€˜[SESSION_ID WITH LONG-RUNNING QUERY]â€™
```

This third query shows how to use the KILL command on the session with the long-running query.

```
KILL â€˜[SESSION_ID WITH LONG-RUNNING QUERY]â€™
```
