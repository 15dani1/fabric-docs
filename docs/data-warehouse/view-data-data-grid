# HowTo: View data using the Data Grid

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

**Applies to:** Warehouse and SQL endpoint 

The **Data grid** is one of the three switcher modes along with the Query editor and Model view within the Warehouse experience that provides an easy interface to view the data within your tables or views to preview sample data (top 1000 rows). 

## Getting started
After creating a Warehouse and ingesting data, click the **Data** tab on the bottom left and choose a specific table or view you would like to view in the Data grid.

**Search value** – Type in a specific keyword in the top right search bar and rows with that specific keyword will be filtered. In this example, “New York” is the keyword and only rows containing this keyword are shown. To clear the search, click on the “X” inside the search bar. 

**Sort columns (alphabetically or numerically)** – Hover over the column title and click on the up/down arrow that appears next to the title.

**Copy value** – Right-click a cell within the table and a Copy option will appear to copy the specific selection.

## Considerations and Limitations 
-	Only the top 1000 rows can be shown in the Data grid. 
-	The Data grid view will change depending on how the columns are sorted or if there’s a keyword that is searched.
