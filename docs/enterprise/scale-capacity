# Scale your Fabric capacity in the Azure portal

This article walks through how to scale a Fabric (Preview) capacity in Microsoft Azure. Scaling allows you to increase or decrease the size of your capacity.

This assumes you created a Fabric capacity (**F SKU**). If you haven't, see [Buy Licenses](licenses-buy.md) to get started.

## Scale a capacity

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Under **Azure services**, select **Microsoft Fabric (Preview)** to see your capacities.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Azure services in Azure portal.](media/scale-capacity/azure-portal-more-services.png)

3. Select the capacity you want to scale. Notice that the current size for each capacity is listed under **SKU**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of Fabric capacity list in Azure portal.](media/scale-capacity/azure-portal-capacity-list.png)

    When you make your selection, information about that capacity is displayed next to it. This information again includes the current scaling under **SKU**.

4. Under **Scale**, select **Change size**.

5. Select a scale and click **Resize**.

6. Confirm your tier by viewing the overview tab. The current pricing tier is listed.
