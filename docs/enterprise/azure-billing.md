# Understand your Azure bill on a Fabric capacity

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

When you use a Fabric capacity, your usage charges appear in the Azure portal under your subscription in the [Azure Cost Management](/cost-management-billing/costs/reporting-get-started) experience.

## Invoice meters

In Azure Cost Management, your cost analysis and invoice show two meters related to your Fabric capacity resource.

* **Fabric Capacity Usage CU** – Represents the Fabric usage on your capacity.

* **Available Capacity Usage CU** – Represents the available capacity that wasn't used by Fabric

The total usage from both meters add up to the cost of the provisioned Fabric capacity.

## Comparing your Azure bill with your usage

Use the [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics](metrics-app-overview-page.md) to correlate your Azure bill with usage analytics generated from your organization’s usage of Fabric.

The default view in the app shows trends in consumption by workload over the past 14 days. The view includes an analysis of billable and preview workloads that aren't used by your capacity and aren't billed.

There are two ways to configure the app to show the *Fabric Billable CU(s)* shown in your bill.

* Use the filters panel to set preview status to false to display only billable capacity usage

* Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to select all the billable workloads.

Usage in the items table is aggregated by workspace, workload type, and item name. The amount of billable usage generated by each item is aggregated by CUs.

To compare the information in the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app to what you're seeing in Azure, filter your cost management view in the Azure portal so that it displays the same time period as the app. Review the cost under the Power BI Capacity Usage CU meter. The price per CU hour for your capacity depends on your capacity's region. You can view the Fabric prices per region in the [Microsoft Fabric pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/) page.
