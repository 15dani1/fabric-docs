# Pause and resume your capacity

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Microsoft Fabric lets you pause and resume your capacity. When your capacity isn't operational, you can pause it to enable cost savings for your organization. Later, when you want to resume work on your capacity, you can reactivate it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pausing a capacity can prevent Microsoft Fabric content from being available. Before you pause your capacity, make sure the capacity is not being used.

## Prerequisites

To pause your capacity you need:

* An [F SKU capacity](buy-subscription.md#azure-skus)

* To be a [Fabric administrator](../admin/microsoft-fabric-admin.md#power-platform-and-power-bi-admin-roles)

## Pause your capacity

Follow these steps to pause your capacity.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select the **Microsoft Fabric (preview)** service to see your capacities. You can search for *Microsoft Fabric (preview)* in the search menu.

3. Select the capacity you want to pause.

4. Select **Pause**.

5. Select **Yes** to confirm you want to pause the capacity.

## Resume your capacity

Restart usage by resuming your capacity. Resuming your capacity also resumes billing. Content that's assigned to this capacity becomes available once the capacity is resumed.
