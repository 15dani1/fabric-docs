# Intro
The Fabric Workload Hub serves as a marketplace users can browse, explore and manage workloads within Fabric. Workloads are categorized into two groups: Core Fabric workloads and those developed by Microsoft partners.

The hub is structured with two main views:

My Workloads: This view lists the workloads that have been added by the user or others within the organization, including built-in workloads that are part of Fabric.
More Workloads: This view showcases all available workloads that can be added to Fabric.

To publish your workload to the Fabric Workload Hub, which is currently in public preview, you can follow these steps:
