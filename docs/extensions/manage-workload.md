# Deploy a workload in Fabric

This article describes how to upload and manage a workload to the Fabric service. Workloads enhance the usability of your service within a familiar workspace, eliminating the need to leave the Fabric environment. Fabric workloads increase user engagement and improve your applicationâ€™s discoverability in the Fabric store, supporting compelling business models. The Fabric workspace includes various components, known as Fabric items, which handle the storage, analysis, and presentation of your data.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy a workload, you must have the following:

* A Fabric account with the *Admin* permissions.
* The [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/) workload solution that you want to deploy. For information about creating a workload solution, see [Create a workload solution](create-workload.md).

## Upload a workload

To upload a workload to the Fabric service, follow these steps:
