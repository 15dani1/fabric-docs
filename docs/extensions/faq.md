# Fabric Workload Design
## What design language is Fabric following?
Fabric controls are aligned to the Fluent 2 design language. Visit the Design language page for more details.

## What are base (.Base) components?
Base components should not be used in designs. They’re meant only as a nested building block for the creation and management of component variants in the toolkit and are not published via the library. Make sure you‘re not using any components prefixed with “.Base” (nested .Base components are fine).

## Where can I find examples of common page layouts in Fabric?
Specific screens in Fabric are collected in the Page examples file while more generic layout templates are available in this file under Page templates.
