# Workload certification (preview)

This article describes the requirements that are needed for a custom workload to be listed in the Microsoft Fabric Workload Hub. Make sure your workload complies with these requirements before you submit your workload for publication.

## Business requirements

Building applications in Fabric is more like creating documents in office than provisioning resources in Azure. While we donâ€™t expect every user to be able to take advantage of every workload in Fabric, each of the workloads must appeal to the broadest set of users.

Fabric is designed to support the largest Tier 1 projects and data sizes. The Fabric platform provides a common set of services that the workload must not replace with their own proprietary services. Consistent use of the platform services across all the workloads ensures a uniform experience and functionality throughout the system.


| Name | Description | Certification method  | Status |Reference  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value to customers | Your offer must provide enough value to justify the investment it takes to learn and use. Your offer should provide significant benefits such as enhanced efficiency, innovative features, or strategic advantages. | Attestation | Required | |
| Terms and conditions | You need to provide your customers with terms and conditions for the offer you provide on the platform. In the terms and conditions you need to highlight the compliancy aspects of your solution. For example, what happens to data at rest and transit? Where are the services you provide Azure customers available from? | Workload Package | Required | [Governance overview and guidance](../governance/governance-compliance-overview.md) |
| Metadata | Metadata such as title, summary, and icon, must be identical in the Workload package manifest and the SaaS offer submission in Partner Center. Add all the assets of the workload such as icons and screenshots under `fe/assests` directory. Your workload package has to comply with the frontend and [backend](extensibility-back-end.md) manifest requirements. | Workload Package | Requried | [Manifest](extensibility-back-end.md)
| Attestation Document | Partners need to provide a page that contains all the information about their workload certification status. This document needs to be linked in the Workload Package and kept up-to-date. You must add the link in the workload metadata manifest under the `supportLink` field in `certification`. The link must also appear in the workload product page in the Workload Hub. | Workload Package | Required | [Example document](publish-workload-attestation-example.md) |
| Trial | Provide an easy and fast trial experience. The trial should be available to the customer without waiting time (less than 5 seconds), and give the them a free and easy way to explore the offered workload. | Attestation | Required |  [Trials](monetization.md#trials) |
| Marketplace Offer | Partners need to enlist a SaaS offer in the Azure Marketplace. This offer can just be a *contact us* listing to get leads from the platform. We expect partners to also transact over the Marketplace. You can build Bring Your Own License (BYOL) capabilities into your workload. | Workload Package | Required | [Commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1000-software-as-a-service-saas)  |

## Design/ UX requirements

To get familiar with the design requirements for your Fabric workload review the [Fabric UX System](https://aka.ms/fabricux). The Fabric UX System provides an overview of the patterns and components that are available in the Fabric UX to accelerate your work. It also includes Fabric UX React and Angular wrapper libraries that integrate with Fluent web components.

Fabric users expect a fast loading UX. Independent of the technical implementation and regional hosting, your workload should load fast within all Fabric regions.

If your service provides other authentication methods to data that was originaly stored in Fabric you need to document this. | Attestation | Required | [Autentication](./authentication-concept.md) |
| OneLake | OneLake is where data is stored in Fabric. Workloads need to integrate with it to store data in the standard formats supported by the platform so that other services can take advantage of it. | Attestation | Required | [OneLake, the OneDrive for data](../onelake/onelake-overview.md) |
| AAD Conditional Access | Enterprise customers require centralized control and management of the identities and credentials used to access their resources and data and, in Microsoft, Azure AD provides that service. If customers have enabled the feature make sure that your service will work with it. | Attestation | Required | [Conditional access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/security-conditional-access) |
| Admin Rest API | Admin REST APIs are an integral part of Fabric admin and governance process. These APIs help Fabric admins in discovering workspaces and items, and enforcing governance such as performing access reviews, etc. | Attestation | Not supported | [Admin REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/admin/items) |

## Security & Compliance requirements

The following table lists compliance requirements for your workload offer.

| Category | Description | Certification method | Status  | References  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Security general | Microsoft customers entrust Fabric with their most sensitive data. As partners implementing workloads can have access to data on it they also have a responsibility to protect that data. To that end we request workloads to  goe through a security assessment, a security review and attest that they dit it. discovered in the process. | Attestation | Requried | [Secure, protect and comply](../governance/governance-compliance-overview#secure-protect-and-comply) |
| Privacy | Microsoft customers entrust Fabric  with their most sensitive data. As such, partners tht build workloads also have a responsibility to protect that data when they access it. To that end we request that every workload goes through a privacy assessment and a privacy review. | Attestation | Required | [Secure, protect and comply](../governance/governance-compliance-overview#secure-protect-and-comply) |
| Data Residency | Fabric is making a Enterprise Promise around data residency not leaving the geography of the tenant not only for stored data but also for data in transit. As a workload you are showing up in Fabric directly and users need to be aware what your commitments to Data Residency are. In the attestation you need to define what our commitments are to the Data Residency of customer data.  | Attestation | Requried | [Data residency in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency/)
| Compliance attestation | Within the Attestation Document you can show customers how your app handles security, data, and compliance. In this self-assessment the Workload developer describes the Workloadâ€™s security attributes and data-handling practices. The publisher attestation document should be hosted on the partner website.  If applicable to your customers, align with additional Fabric certifications. | Attestation | Optional | [Governance overview and guidance](../governance/governance-compliance-overview.md) |
