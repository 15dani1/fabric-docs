# User flow 4: Explore your data visually in Real-Time Dashboards

By visually drilling into data, you can identify trends, anomalies, and correlations that might not be immediately apparent. This exploration allows you to gain a more nuanced understanding of the data and optimize your operations, improve their products and services, and gain a competitive advantage.

This user flow shows how an insights explorer can use a Real-Time Dashboard to understand real world high granularity data, extract insights, visually drill into specific activities, and identify actions to take.

1. Aggregate and split the data by one or more dimensions of the data.
1. Remove existing query statements to increase or decrease the data scope.
1. View the resulting visualization in the updated tile.

## Potential use cases
