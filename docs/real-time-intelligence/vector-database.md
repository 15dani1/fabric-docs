## Vector databases




We need to add a page for vector support in RTI. The doc should contain:
What is vector database
Why it is important/use cases
Intro to semantic search
Capabilities in Kusto:
Dynamic column support - to store vector
Vector16 encoding policy. .alter column policy encoding command - Azure Data Explorer & Real-Time Intelligence | Microsoft Learn
Cosine similarity function for search. series_cosine_similarity() - Azure Data Explorer & Real-Time Intelligence | Microsoft Learn

We can start by taking content from my blog.
