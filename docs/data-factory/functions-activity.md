# Use the Functions activity to run Azure Functions

The Functions activity in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric allows you to run Azure Functions.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
- A workspace is created.

## Add a Functions activity to a pipeline with UI

To use a Functions activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

### Create the activity

1. Create a new pipeline in your workspace.
1. Search for Functions in the pipeline **Activities** pane, and select it to add it to the pipeline canvas.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may need to expand the menu and scroll down to see the Functions activity as highlighted in the following screenshot.

1. Select the new Functions activity on the pipeline editor canvas if it isn't already selected.

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Functions activity settings

Select the **Settings** tab, then you can choose an existing or create a new **Azure Function connection**, provide a **Function relative URL** that points to the relative path to the Azure App function within the Azure Function connection, and an HTTP **Method** to be submitted to the URL. You can also specify as many additional **Headers** as required for the function you are executing.

## Save and run or schedule the pipeline

After you configure any other activities required for your pipeline, switch to the **Home** tab at the top of the pipeline editor, and select the save button to save your pipeline. Select **Run** to run it directly, or **Schedule** to schedule it. You can also view the run history here or configure other settings.
