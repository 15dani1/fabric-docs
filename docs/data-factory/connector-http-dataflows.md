# Connect to HTTP data in dataflows

You can connect to HTTP in Dataflow Gen2 using the Web page connector provided by Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric.

[!INCLUDE [df-preview-warning](includes/data-factory-preview-warning.md)]

## Connect to HTTP data

To connect to HTTP data from a dataflow:

1. From your workspace, select **New** > **Dataflow Gen2 (Preview)** to create a new dataflow.

1. In Power Query, either select **Get data** in the ribbon or select **Get data from another source** in the current view.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-http/get-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the get data option in the Power Query ribbon.":::

1. From **Choose data source**, select the **Other** category, and then select **Web page**.

1. In **Connect to data source**, under **Connection settings**, enter the URL of the HTTP page.

1. Select the on-premises data gateway in **Data gateway**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The Web page connector requires a gateway. If you want to access a non-HTML resource without the gateway, use the Web API connector or one of the File connectors instead.

1. Select the authentication type to use in **Authentication kind**, and then enter your credentials. The authentication kinds supported by the Web page connector are:

   - Anonymous
   - Basic
   - Organizational account
   - Windows

1. Select **Next**.

1. In **Choose data**, select the data item that you want to transform, and then select **Next**.
