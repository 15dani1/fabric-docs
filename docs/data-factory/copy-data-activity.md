Learn how to add a copy activity directly or through the copy assistant.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](/trident-docs-private-preview/synapse-data-integration/url).
- A workspace is created.

## Add a copy activity using copy assistant

Follow these steps to set up your copy activity using copy assistant.

### Step 1: Start with copy assistant

1. Open an existing data pipeline or create a new data pipeline.
1. Select **Copy data** on the canvas to open the **Copy Assistant** tool to get started. Or select **Use copy assistant** from the **Copy data** drop down list under the **Activities** tab on the ribbon.

   1. After you select **New connection**, it will navigate to the connection creation page in a new browser. Fill in the required connection information on the panel and then select **Create**. For the details of connection creation for each type of data source, you can refer to each [Power Query connector article](/power-query/connectors/).

      :::image type="content" source="media/copy-data-activity/configure-source-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the New connection page." lightbox="media/copy-data-activity/configure-source-details.png":::

   1. Once your connection is created successfully, it will take you back to the previous page. Then select **Refresh** to fetch the connection that you created and go to the next step. You could also choose an existing blob connection from the drop-down directly if you already created it before.

      :::image type="content" source="media/copy-data-activity/refresh-source-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Refresh." lightbox="media/copy-data-activity/refresh-source-connection.png":::

3. Choose the file or folder to be copied in this source configuration step, and then select **Next**.

### Step 3: Configure your destination

1. Choose your destination by choosing a data source type. In this tutorial, you'll use Azure Blob Storage as an example. Select**Azure Blob Storage**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/copy-data-activity/choose-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select Azure Blob Storage." lightbox="media/copy-data-activity/choose-destination.png":::

2. You can either create a new connection that links to a new Azure Blob Storage account by following the steps in the previous section or use an existing connection from the connection drop-down list. The capabilities of **Test connection** and **Edit** are available to each selected connection.

   :::image type="content" source="media/copy-data-activity/destination-connection-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing data connection options." lightbox="media/copy-data-activity/destination-connection-configuration.png":::

3. Configure and map your source data to your destination; then select **Next** to finish your destination configurations.
