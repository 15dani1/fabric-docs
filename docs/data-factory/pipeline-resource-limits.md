# Data pipeline resource limits

The following table describes the resource limitations for pipelines in Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric.

| Pipeline Resource | Default limit | Maximum limit |
|---|---|---|
| Total number of entities, such as pipelines, activities, triggers within a workspace | 5,000 | 5,000 |
| Concurrent pipeline runs per data factory that's shared among all pipelines in workspace  | 10,000 | 10,000 |
| External activities  like stored procedure, Web, Web Hook, and others | 3,000 | 3,000 |
| Pipeline activities execute on integration runtime, including Lookup, GetMetadata, and Delete | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Concurrent authoring operations, including test connection, browse folder list and table list, preview data, and so on | 200 | 200 |
| Maximum activities per pipeline, which includes inner activities for containers | 40 | 40 |
| Maximum parameters per pipeline | 50 | 50 |
| ForEach items | 100,000 | 100,000 |
| ForEach parallelism | 20 | 50 |
| Lookup Activity item count | 5000 | 5000 |
| Maximum queued runs per pipeline | 100 | 100 |
| Characters per expression | 8,192 | 8,192 |
| Maximum timeout for pipeline activity runs | 24 hours | 24 hours |

| Bytes per object for dataset and linked service objects3 | 100 KB | 2,000 KB |
| Bytes per payload for each activity run4 | 896 KB | 896 KB |
