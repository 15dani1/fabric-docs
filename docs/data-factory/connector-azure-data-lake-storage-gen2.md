    :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-common/new-connection-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the New connection pane." lightbox="./media/connector-common/new-connection-pane.png":::

## Set up your connection

### Step 1: Specify the new connection name, type, server and full path

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2/connection-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to set a new connection.":::

In the **New connection** pane, choose **Cloud**, and specify the following fields:

- **Connection name**: Specify a name for your connection.
- **Connection type**: Select a type for your connection.
- **Server**: Enter your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 server name. For example, `https://contosoadlscdm.dfs.core.windows.net`. Specify your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 server name. Go to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account interface, browse to the **Endpoints** section, and get your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Full path**: Enter the full path to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container name.

### Step 2:  Select and set your authentication

Under **Authentication method**, select your authentication from the drop-down list and complete the related configuration. The Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 connector supports the following authentication types:

- [Key](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.md#key-authentication)
- [OAuth2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.md#oauth2-authentication)
- [Shared Access Signature](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.md#shared-access-signature-authentication)
- [Service Principal](connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.md#service-principal-authentication)

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2/authentication-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the authentication method for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.":::

#### Key authentication

**Account key**: Specify your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account key. Go to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account interface, browse to the **Access key** section, and get your account key.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2/key-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that key authentication method for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.":::

#### OAuth2 authentication

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2/oauth2-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that OAuth2 authentication method for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.":::

Open **Edit credentials**. The sign-in interface opens. Enter your account and password to sign in to your account. After signing in, you'll come back to the **New connection** page.

#### Shared access signature authentication

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2/sas-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that shared access signature authentication method for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.":::

**SAS token**: Specify the shared access signature token for your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container.  

If you don’t have a SAS token, switch to **Shared access signature** in your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account interface. Under **Allowed resource types**, select **Container**, and then select **Generate SAS and connection string**. You can get your SAS token from the generated content that appears.
The shared access signature is a URI that encompasses in its query parameters all the information necessary for authenticated access to a storage resource. To access storage resources with the shared access signature, the client only needs to pass in the shared access signature to the appropriate constructor or method.
For more information about shared access signatures, go to [Shared access signatures: Understand the shared access signature model](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview).

#### Service principal authentication

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2/service-principal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that service principal authentication method for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.":::

- **Tenant Id**: Specify the tenant information (domain name or tenant ID) under which your application resides. Retrieve it by hovering over the upper-right corner of the Azure portal.
- **Service principal ID**: Specify the application (client) ID.
- **Service principal key**: Specify your application's key.

To use service principal authentication, follow these steps:

1. Register an application entity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by following [Register your application with an Azure AD tenant](/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app?tabs=dotnet#register-your-application-with-an-azure-ad-tenant). Make note of these values, which you use to define the connection:
   - Tenant ID
   - Application ID
   - Application key

2. Grant the service principal proper permission. For examples of how permission works in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, go to [Access control lists on files and directories](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control#access-control-lists-on-files-and-directories).

   - **As source**, in Storage Explorer, grant at least **Execute** permission for all upstream folders and the file system, along with **Read** permission for the files to copy. Alternatively, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role.
   - **As destination**, in Storage Explorer, grant at least **Execute** permission for all upstream folders and the file system, along with **Write** permission for the destination folder. Alternatively, in Access control (IAM), grant at least the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use a UI to author and the service principal isn't set with the "Storage Blob Data Reader/Contributor" role in IAM, when doing a test connection or browsing/navigating folders, choose **Test connection to file path** or **Browse from specified path**, and then specify a path with **Read + Execute** permission to continue.

### Step 3: Specify the privacy level you want to apply

In the **General** tab, select the privacy level that you want apply in the **Privacy level** drop-down list. Three privacy levels are supported. For more information, go to General.
