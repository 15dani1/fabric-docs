# Concept: Data pipeline Runs

A data pipeline run occurs when a data pipeline is executed. This means that the activities in your data pipeline will run and be executed to completion. For example, running a data pipeline with a **Copy data** activity will perform that action and copy your data. Each data pipeline run will have its own unique pipeline run ID.

A data pipeline run can be triggered one of two ways, either on-demand or by setting up a schedule. A scheduled pipeline will be able to run based on the time and frequency that you set.

## On-demand data pipeline run

To manually trigger a data pipeline run, select **Run** found in the top banner of the **Home** tab.

You'll be prompted to save your changes before triggering the pipeline run. Select **Save and run** to continue.

After your changes are saved, your pipeline will run. You can view the progress of the run in the **Output** tab found at the bottom of the canvas.

Once an activity has completed in a run, a green check mark appears in the corner of the activity.

Once the entire pipeline has been executed and the output status updates to **Succeeded**, you've had a successful pipeline run!

## Scheduled data pipeline runs

When you schedule a data pipeline run, you can choose the frequency that your pipeline runs. Select **Schedule**, found in the top banner of the **Home** tab, to view your options. By default, your data pipeline won't be set on a schedule.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/run-schedule-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Schedule configuration screen." lightbox="media/pipeline-runs/run-schedule-configuration.png":::

To set a schedule, choose the **Frequency-based run** option. This selection will bring up your scheduling options.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/frequency-based-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select Frequency-based run." lightbox="media/pipeline-runs/frequency-based-run.png":::

Set your interval and select the granularity. You can choose between Minute(s), Hour(s), Day(s), Week(s), and Month(s).

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/set-interval.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select run intervals.":::

Then, choose your start date either by typing the date in manually or using the date picker.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/run-start-date.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to enter run start date.":::

You can also set a start time. For example, if you wanted your pipeline to run at 9:00 AM every morning, you can update the time to 09:00:00.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/run-start-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to enter run start time.":::

You can also update the time zone. Use the drop-down list and filter to find the time zone youâ€™d like to use.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/run-time-zone.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select your preferred time zone.":::

Once configured, select **Ok** to set your schedule.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-runs/set-schedule-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select OK.":::

A schedule is now set on your pipeline editing canvas, detailing how often your pipeline is set to run.
