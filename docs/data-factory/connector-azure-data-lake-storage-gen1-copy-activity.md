### General

Refer to the [**General** settings](activity-overview.md#general-settings) guidance to configure the **General** settings tab.

### Source

The following properties are supported for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 under the **Source** tab of a copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/source.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing source tab.":::

The following properties are **required**:

- **Data store type**: Select **External**.
- **Connection**:  Select an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 connection from the connection list. If no connection exists, then create a new Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 connection by selecting **New**.
- **Connection type**: Select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1**.
- **File path type**: You can choose **File path**, **Name range**, **Wildcard file path**, or **List of files** as your file path type. The configuration of each of these settings isï¼š

  - **File path**: If you choose this type, the data can be copied from the specified folder/file path.
  - **Name range**: Retrieve folders/files with names before or after a specific value in alphabetical order. It utilizes the service-side filter for ADLS Gen1, which provides better performance than a wildcard filter. For more examples, got to [Name range filter examples](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-store#name-range-filter-examples).
      :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/name-range.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing name range.":::

      - **Folder path**: The path to a folder in your source data.  

      - **List after**: Retrieve the folders/files whose name is after this value alphabetically (exclusive).

      - **List before**: Retrieve the folders/files whose name is before this value alphabetically (inclusive).
  
  - **Wildcard file path**: Specify the folder or file path with wildcard characters to filter source folders or files.

    Allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character). Use `^` to escape if your folder name has wildcard or this escape character inside. For more examples, go to [Folder and file filter examples](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-store#folder-and-file-filter-examples).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/wildcard-file-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing wildcard file path.":::

    *Wildcard folder path*: Specify the folder path with wildcard characters to filter source folders.

    *Wildcard file name*: Specify the file name with wildcard characters under the configured folder/wildcard folder path to filter source files.

  - **List of files**: Indicates you want to copy a given file set. Specify **Folder path** and **Path to file list** to point to a text file that includes a list of files you want to copy, one file per line, which is the relative path to the path. For more examples, go to [File list examples](/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-store#file-list-examples).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/path-to-file-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing path to file list.":::
    - **Folder path**: Specify the path to a folder. It is required.

    - **Path to file list**: Specify the path of the text file that includes a list of files you want to copy.

- **Recursively**: Specify whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. Note that when **Recursively** is selected and the destination is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the destination. This property is selected by default and doesn't apply when you configure **Path to file list**.

- **File format**: Select the file format applied from the drop-down list. Select **Settings** to configure the file format. For settings of different file formats, refer to articles in [Supported format](#supported-format) for detailed information.

Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Filter by last modified**: Files are filtered based on the last modified dates. This property doesn't apply when you configure your file path type as List of files.

  - **Start time (UTC)**: The files are selected if their last modified time is greater than or equal to the configured time.
  - **End time (UTC)**: The files are selected if their last modified time is less than the configured time.

  When **Start time (UTC)** has datetime value but **End time (UTC)** is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal with the datetime value will be selected. When **End time (UTC)** has datetime value but **Start time (UTC)** is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value will be selected. The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter will be applied to the data.

- **Enable partition discovery**: Specify whether to parse the partitions from the file path and add them as additional source columns. It is unselected by default and not supported when you use binary file format.

  - **Partition root path**: When partition discovery is enabled, specify the absolute root path in order to read partitioned folders as data columns.

    If it is not specified, by default,
    - When you use file path or list of files on source, partition root path is the path that you configured.
    - When you use wildcard folder filter, partition root path is the sub-path before the first wildcard.

    For example, assuming you configure the path as `root/folder/year=2020/month=08/day=27`:

    - If you specify partition root path as `root/folder/year=2020`, copy activity will generate two more columns month and day with value "08" and "27" respectively, in addition to the columns inside the files.
    - If partition root path is not specified, no extra column will be generated.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/partition-discovery.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing partition discovery.":::

- **Max concurrent connections**: This property indicates the upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.

- **Additional columns**: Add additional data columns to store source files' relative path or static value. Expression is supported for the latter.

## Destination

The following properties are supported for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 under the **Destination** tab of a copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing destination tab.":::

The following properties are **required**:

- **Data store type**: Select **External**.
- **Connection**: Select an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 connection from the connection list. If the connection doesn't exist, then create a new Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 connection by selecting **New**.
- **Connection type**: Select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1**.
- **File path**: Select **Browse** to choose the file that you want to copy or fill in the path manually.
- **File format**: Select the file format applied from the drop-down list. Select **Settings** to configure the file format. For settings of different file formats, refer to articles in [Supported format](#supported-format) for detailed information.

Under **Advanced**, you can specify the following fields:

- **Copy behavior**: Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store. You can choose a behavior from the drop-down list.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-azure-data-lake-storage-gen1/copy-behavior.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing copy behavior.":::

  - **Flatten hierarchy**: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the destination folder. The destination files have autogenerated names.
  - **Merge files**: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an auto-generated file name.
  - **Preserve hierarchy**: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of source file to source folder is identical to the relative path of target file to target folder.

- **Max concurrent connections**: The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.

- **Expiry datetime (UTC)**: Specifies the expiry time of the written files. The time is applied to the UTC time in the format of "2020-03-01T08:00:00Z". By default it's NULL, which means the written files are never expired.

### Mapping

For **Mapping** tab configuration, go to [Configure your mappings under mapping tab](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-mappings-under-mapping-tab). If you choose Binary as your file format, mapping will not be supported.

### Settings

For the **Settings** tab configuration, go to [Configure your other settings under settings tab](copy-data-activity.md#configure-your-other-settings-under-settings-tab).
