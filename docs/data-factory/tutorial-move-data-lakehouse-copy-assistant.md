# Move data from Azure SQL DB into Lakehouse via copy assistant

This tutorial describes the steps to move data into Lakehouse.

[!INCLUDE [df-preview-warning](includes/data-factory-preview-warning.md)]

Two approaches are provided using the copy assistant:

1. The first approach moves source data into destination tables with delta format.
2. The second approach moves source data into destination files.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- A tenant account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.
- A workspace is created.
- A Lakehouse is created in your workspace.

## Move files into Lakehouse as tables in delta format via copy assistant

Follow these steps to set up your copy activity.

### Step 1: Start with copy assistant

1. Open an existing data pipeline or create a new data pipeline.

2. Select **Copy data** on the canvas to open the **Copy Assistant** tool to get started. Or select **Use copy assistant** from the **Copy data** drop down list under **Activities** tab on the ribbon.

   > [!Note]
   > Currently data lands into Lakehouse Tables folders (a managed area) in Delta format only. Those files will be automatically registered as a table and be visible under Table view from Lakehouse portal.
   > Only the first layer folders under Tables will be registered as delta table.
   > Browsing or Previewing from Lakehouse Table isn't supported yet.
   > Data that gets loaded into the same table will be appended. Delete or Update to tables isn't supported yet.
