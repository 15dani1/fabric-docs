# Tutorial: Application lifecycle management in Fabric

This tutorial will take you through the whole process of loading data into your workspace, editing it etc.
If you already have a workspace with data, you can skip to [step 3](#step-3-create-pipeline).

Letâ€™s get started!

> * Prepare and load data into a lakehouse
> * Build a dimensional model in a lakehouse
> * Automatically create a report with quick create

## Prerequisites

* Before you start, if you haven't enabled Fabric yet, [enable Fabric for your organization](../admin/fabric-switch.md)
* If you aren't signed up yet, [sign up for a free trial](../get-started/fabric-trial.md).
* Create a [new workspace](../collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces.md) and assign a Fabric capacity.
     An existing workspace can also be used, although we recommend using a nonproduction workspace for simplicity of the tutorial.
* Azure git repo
* Download the [MyFoodsIncome](https://github.com/microsoft/pbiworkshops/raw/main/_Asset%20Library/Source_Files/ContosoSales.pqt) *.pbix* file that contains sample data for this tutorial. You can also use your own data, if you prefer.
