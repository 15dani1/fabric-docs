# Git integration overview

[Source ppt](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/TridentGitIntegration43/EXyICsAL3F1Bu18iVr2SpOsBu0Nf04-8Rh9ljs6tU5VLfw?e=gaq21P)

Git integration in Trident enables Pro developers to integrate their development processes, tools, and best practices straight into the [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] platform. While developing in [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)], developers can backup and version their work, rollback as needed, collaborate or work in isolation using Git branches, and leverage the capabilities of familiar source control tools to manage [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] items.

The integration with source control is on the workspace level. This enables developers to eventually manage all [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] items in source control, and version all their items within a workspace in a single process and with full visibility.

With git integration, you can synchronize a [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] workspace with a git repository and easily do the following tasks and more without leaving your workspace:

- Save your work.
- Keep a backup of your work so you can revert if necessary.​
- Collaborate with team members and ensure that changes don't conflict with each other.​
- Manage and release content using familiar tools and processes.

## Basic git concepts

Git is a popular distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of files.

Connect
commit
branch
pull request
merge

## Map your workspace to git

### Classic git workflow

Five stations

### [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] git workflow

Two stations

- We don’t store and don’t allow editing artifact definition files directly​
- We don’t deal with merges

Gets rid of intermediary steps. Automatically checks out and pushed data.

## Main workflows

### Single author in [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] workspace

### Authoring through Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Multiple authors in [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] workspace

## Permissions
