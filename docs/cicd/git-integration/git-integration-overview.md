# Overview of git integration

Git integration in [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] enables Pro developers to integrate their development processes, tools, and best practices straight into the [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] platform. It allows developers who are developing in [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] to:

* Backup and version their work
* Rollback as needed
* Collaborate or work in isolation using Git branches
* Leverage the capabilities of familiar source control tools to manage [!INCLUDE[Trident](../../includes/product-name.md)] items.

The integration with source control is on a workspace level so and developers can version all the items they develop within a workspace in a single process, with full visibility to all their items.
