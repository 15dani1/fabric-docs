# Conflict resolution

A conflict occurs when changes are made *to the same item* in both the workspace and the remote git repository. When a conflict occurs, the git status says **Conflict** and both **Commit** and **Update** are disabled until the conflict is resolved.

You have two options:

- Revert either the workspace or the git repository to a previous synced state OR
- Resolve the conflict in git.

## Revert to a previous synced state

If you revert to a previous synced state, you lose the changes made after that sync. If you revert the git branch to a previous synced branch, you can still see the changes made to the unsynced branch, If you revert the workspace, the changes are lost completely.

Use the undo command in the workspace to revert to last synced state.
To revert to the prior synced state, do one of the following steps:

- Return the workspace to the last synced state by using the [Undo](./git-get-started.md#commit-changes-to-git) command in the conflicted item.
- Revert to the last synced state in git using the git `revert command`.

 You can also revert to a previous state by disconnecting and reconnecting the workspace. When you reconnect, [select the direction](./git-integration-process.md#connect-and-sync) you want to sync.

## Resolve conflict in git

If you made numerous changes and donâ€™t want to revert to a previous state, you can try resolving the conflict in the git repo:

1. Check out new branch using the last synced branch ID shown on bottom of screen
1. Resolve the conflict in git
1. Merge the new branch into the original branch
1. Disconnect and reconnect to original branch
