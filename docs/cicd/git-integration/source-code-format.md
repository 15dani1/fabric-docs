# Git integration source code format

Each item in Microsoft Fabric is represented in Git as a directory. Each directory has the same name as the artifact followed by the type.

Inside each directory are the mandatory system files that define the item. Besides these files, there are two automatically generated system files in each directory:

- [item.metadata.json](#metadata-file)
- [item.config.json](#config-file)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Metadata file

```json
{ 
    "type": <string>, 
    "displayName": <string>,
    "description": <string>
} 
```

The item.metadata.json file contains the following attributes:

- `type`: the item’s type (dataset, report etc.)
- `displayName`: the name of the item
- `description`: (optional) description of the item

To rename an item, change the `displayName` in the ‘item.metadata.json’ file. Changing the name of the folder doesn’t change the display name of the item in the workspace.

## Config file

```json
{ 
    version: <string>, 
    logicalId: <guid>, 
} 
```

The `item.config.json` file contains the following attributes:

- `version`: version number of the system files. This number is used to enable backwards compatibility. Version number of the item might be different.
- `logicalId`: an automatically generated cross-workspace identifier representing an item and its source control representation.

The logicalId connects an item in a workspace with its corresponding item in a git branch. Items with the same logicalIds are assumed to be the same. The logicalId preserves the link even if the name or directory change. Since a branch can be synced to multiple workspaces, it’s possible to have items in different workspaces with the same logicalId, but a single workspace can’t have two items with the same logicalId. The logicalId is created when the workspace is connected to a git branch or a new item is synced. The logicalId is necessary for git integration to function properly. Therefore, it’s essential not to change it in any way.

## Item definition files

Besides the item.config.json file and the item.metadata.json file found in all item folders, each item's directory has specific files that define that item.

### Dataset files

Dataset directories contain the following files:

- definition.pbidataset
- model.bim

### Report files

Report directories contain the following files:

- definition.pbir
- report.json
