# New deployment pipelines user interface (preview)

The user interface for Microsoft Fabric's Deployment pipelines is undergoing a change to improve the user experience. The new UI is designed to be more focused, easier to navigate, and have a smoother flow. The functionality has stayed the same, and anything you can do with the original UI you can do with the new UI.

> [!NOTE]
> The new UI is currently in preview and is available to all users. The old UI is still available and can be accessed by using the [toggle switch](#begin-using-the-new-ui) in the upper right corner of the page.

## What changed in the new UI

The new UI offers several improvements and a change in the workflow concept over the old UI.

### New workflow concept

The focus of the deployment is the stage you're deploying to. The target stage is where you can see the deployment history, create rules, and deploy. This is a more consistent and intuitive experience.

Whereas in the original UI, you deployed content while in the source stage, but created rules while in the target stage, in the new UI, everything is done from the same stage.

### Enhanced experience

The new UI contains advanced functionalities for a better experience. Some of these functionalities include:

* Search an item
* Filter by item type or sync status
* Sort by name, type, or sync status
* Zoom in/out in the pipeline view
* Contextual editing

## What remains unchanged

The following deployment pipeline features remain unchanged:

* [Deployment history](./deployment-history.md)
* [Change review](./compare-pipeline-content.md)
* [APIs](./pipeline-automation.md)
* The Deployment pipelines home page
* Deployment pipelines entry points

## Begin using the new UI

Switch between the new and old UIs using the toggle switch in the upper right corner.

Your selection is saved and will be remembered the next time you visit the page. You can switch back and forth as many times as you like.
