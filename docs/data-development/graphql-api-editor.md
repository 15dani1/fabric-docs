# GraphQL API editor

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Fabric GraphQL API is in preview.

The GraphQL API comes with an editor that allows you to easily develop and test your GraphQL code against the API.

To go to the editor, navigate to the Data Development experience and select the **Query** button at the lower left corner of your Fabric portal screen.

The editor screen appears:

You can type code directly on the **Query** tab. Intellisense capabilities are available with a keyboard shortcut: CTRL + Space (Windows), or Command + Space (macOS).

## Development of queries and mutations

The following video shows how quickly you can develop an API call using our intellisense-aided editor experience:

## Query variables

Use the **Query variables** pane on the right side of the **Query** tab to pass any parameters as variables to your queries or mutations.
