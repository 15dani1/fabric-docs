# Enable Copilot for Microsoft Fabric (preview)

Before your business can start using Copilot capabilities in Microsoft Fabric, you need to enable Copilot. Copilot doesn't work for trial SKUs. You need a F64 or P1 capacity to use Copilot.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Your administrator needs to enable the tenant switch before you start using Copilot. See the article [Copilot tenant settings](../admin/service-admin-portal-copilot.md) for details. 
> - Your F64 or P1 capacity needs to be in one of the regions listed in this article, [Fabric region availability](../admin/region-availability.md).
> - Copilot in Microsoft Fabric isn't supported on trial SKUs. Only paid SKUs (F64 or higher, or P1 or higher) are supported.

With Copilot and other generative AI features in preview, Microsoft Fabric brings a new way to transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports.

All customers with a paid Fabric capacity (F64 or higher) or Power BI Premium capacity (P1 or higher) have access to the Copilot preview. It becomes available to you automatically as a new setting in the Fabric admin portal. When charging begins for the Copilot in Fabric experiences, you can count Copilot usage against your existing Fabric or Power BI Premium capacity.

See the article [Copilot tenant settings (preview)](../admin/service-admin-portal-copilot.md) for details.
