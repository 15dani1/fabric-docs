# Enable Copilot for Microsoft Fabric (preview)

Before your business can start using Copilot capabilities in Microsoft Fabric, you need to enable Copilot.
With Copilot and other generative AI features in preview, Microsoft Fabric brings a new way to transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports.

The preview of Copilot in Microsoft Fabric is rolling out in stages with the goal that all customers with Fabric capacity (F64 or higher) or Power BI Premium capacity (P1 or higher) have access to the Copilot preview. It becomes available to you automatically as a new setting in the Fabric admin portal when it's rolled out to your tenant. When charging begins for the Copilot in Fabric experiences, you can count Copilot usage against your existing Fabric or Power BI Premium capacity.

We're enabling Copilot in stages. Everyone will have the access by March 2024. We should have the section called Available regions in the Fabric overview doc and then link to Ruxin doc. 

See the article [Copilot tenant settings (preview)](../admin/service-admin-portal-copilot.md) for details.
