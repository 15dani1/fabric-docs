# Promote or certify items

Fabric provides two ways you can endorse your valuable, high-quality items to increase their visibility: **promotion** and **certification**.

* **Promotion**: Promotion is a way to highlight items you think are valuable and worthwhile for others to use. It encourages the collaborative use and spread of content within an organization.

    Any item owner, as well as any member with write permissions on the workspace where the item is located, can promote the item when they think it's good enough for sharing.

* **Certification**: Certification means that the item meets the organization's quality standards and can be regarded as reliable, authoritative, and ready for use across the organization.

    Only [authorized reviewers (defined by the Power BI administrator)](../admin/endorsement-setup.md) can certify items. Item owners who wish to see their item certified and aren't authorized to certify it themselves need to follow their organization's guidelines about getting items certified.

Currently it's possible to endorse all Fabric items except Power BI dashboards.

This article describes how to [promote items](#promote-items), how to [certify items](#certify-items) if you're an authorized reviewer, and how to [request certification](#request-item-certification) if you're not.

See the [endorsement overview](../governance/endorsement-overview.md) to learn more about endorsement.

## Promote items

To promote an item, you must have write permissions on the workspace where the content you want to promote is located.

1. Go to the settings of the content you want to promote.

1. Expand the endorsement section and select **Promoted**.

    If you're promoting a Power BI dataset and see a **Make discoverable** checkbox, it means you can make it possible for users who don't have access to the dataset to find it. See [dataset discovery](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) for more detail.

1. Select **Apply**.

## Certify items

Item certification is a significant responsibility, and only authorized users can certify items. Other users can [request item certification](#request-item-certification). This section describes how to certify an item.

1. Get write permissions on the workspace where the item you want to certify is located. You can request these permissions from the item owner or from anyone who as an admin role in workspace.

1. Carefully review the item and determine whether it meets your organization's certification standards.

1. If you decide to certify the item, go to the workspace where it resides, and open the settings of the item you want to certify.

1. Expand the endorsement section and select **Certified**.

    If you're certifying a Power BI dataset and see a **Make discoverable** checkbox, it means you can make it possible for users who don't have access to the dataset to find it. See [dataset discovery](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) for more detail.

## Request item certification

If you would like to certify your item but aren't authorized to do so, follow the steps below.

1. Go to the workspace where the item you want to be certified is located, and then open the settings of that item.

1. Expand the endorsement section. The **Certified** button is greyed out since you aren't authorized to certify content. Select the link about how to get your item certified.
