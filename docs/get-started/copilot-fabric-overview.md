# Overview of Copilot for Fabric (preview)

With Copilot and other generative AI features in preview, Microsoft Fabric brings a new way to transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports.

Before your business starts using Copilot capabilities in Fabric, you may have questions about how it works, how it keeps your business data secure and adheres to privacy requirements, and how to use generative AI responsibly. Read on for answers to these and other questions.

## How do I use Copilot responsibly?

Microsoft is committed to ensuring that our AI systems are guided by our [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach/) and [Responsible AI Standard](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE5cmFl). These principles include empowering our customers to use these systems effectively and in line with their intended uses. Our approach to responsible AI is continually evolving to proactively address emerging issues. Copilot sends your customer data to generate summaries to Azure OAI, where it's stored for 30 days. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms) for details.

The article [Privacy, security, and responsible use for Copilot (preview)](copilot-privacy-security.md) offers guidance on responsible use.

Copilot features in Fabric are built to meet the Responsible AI Standard, which means that they're reviewed by multidisciplinary teams for potential harms, and then refined to include mitigations for those harms.  

Before you use Copilot, your admin needs to enable Copilot in Fabric. See the article [Enable Copilot in Fabric (preview)](copilot-fabric-enable.md) for details. Also, keep in mind the limitations of Copilot:

- Copilot responses can include inaccurate or low-quality content, so make sure to review outputs before using them in your work.
- Reviews of outputs should be done by people who are able to meaningfully evaluate the content's accuracy and appropriateness.
- Today, Copilot features work best in the English language. Other languages may not perform as well.
