# Apply sensitivity labels to Fabric items

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection on your reports, dashboards, datasets, dataflows, and .pbix files can guard your sensitive content against unauthorized data access and leakage. Labeling your data correctly with sensitivity labels ensures that only authorized people can access your data. This article shows you how to apply sensitivity labels in the Power BI service and in Power BI Desktop.

For more information about sensitivity labels in Power BI, see Sensitivity labels in Power BI.

## Prerequisites

Requirements needed to apply sensitivity labels in the Power BI service:

You must have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license and edit permissions on the content you wish to label.
Sensitivity labels must be enabled for your organization. Contact your Power BI admin if you aren't sure about this.
You must belong to a security group that has permissions to apply sensitivity labels, as described in Enable sensitivity labels in Power BI.
All licensing and other requirements must have been met.
When data protection is enabled on your tenant, sensitivity labels appear in the sensitivity column in the list view of dashboards, reports, datasets, and dataflows.

For the list of sensitivity label limitations in Power BI, see Sensitivity labels in Power BI.
