# Apply sensitivity labels to Fabric items

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection on items can guard your sensitive content against unauthorized data access and leakage. They are a key component in helping your organization meet its governance and compliance requirements. Labeling your data correctly with sensitivity labels ensures that only authorized people can access your data. This article shows you how to apply sensitivity labels to your Microsoft Fabric items.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about applying sensitivity labels in Power BI Desktop, see [Apply sensitivity labels in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/enterprise/service-security-apply-data-sensitivity-labels#apply-sensitivity-labels-in-power-bi-desktop).

## Prerequisites

Requirements needed to apply sensitivity labels to Fabric items:

> [If you can't apply a sensitivity label, or if the sensitivity label is greyed out in the sensitivity label menu, you may not have permissions to use the label. Contact your organizations tech support.]
