# Promote your Fabric content

Power BI provides two ways you can endorse your valuable, high-quality content to increase its visibility: **promotion** and **certification**.

* **Promotion**: Promotion is a way to highlight content you think is valuable and worthwhile for others to use. It encourages the collaborative use and spread of content within an organization.

    Any content owner, as well as any member with write permissions on the workspace where the content is located, can promote the content when they think it's good enough for sharing.

* **Certification**: Certification means that the content meets the organization's quality standards and can be regarded as reliable, authoritative, and ready for use across the organization.

    Only [authorized reviewers (defined by the Power BI administrator)](../admin/endorsement-setup.md) can certify content. Content owners who wish to see their content certified and are not authorized to certify it themselves need to follow their organization's guidelines about getting their content certified.

Currently it is possible to endorse
* Datasets
* Dataflows
* Reports
* Apps

If [dataset discoverability](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) has been enabled in your organization, endorsed datasets can be made discoverable. When a dataset is discoverable, users who don't have access to it will be able to find it and request access. See [Dataset discoverability](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) for more detail.

This article describes how to [promote content](#promote-content), how to [certify content](endorsement-certify.md#certify-content) if you're an authorized reviewer, and how to [request certification](endorsement-certify.md#request-content-certification) if you're not.

See [Endorsement: Promoting and certifying Power BI content](endorsement-overview.md) to learn more about endorsement.

## Promote content

To promote content, you must have write permissions the workspace where the content you want to promote is located.

>[!NOTE]
>For the purposes of illustration, the endorsement dialog for datasets is shown below. The dialogs for the other content types are almost identical, with the same radio button options. 

1. Go to the [settings](#how-to-get-to-content-settings) of the content you want to promote.

1. Expand the endorsement section and select **Promoted**.

    If you are promoting a dataset and see a **Make discoverable** checkbox, it means you can make it possible for users who don't have access to the dataset to find it. See [dataset discovery](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-discovery) for more detail.

    If you're promoting a dataset, make sure the dataset has an informative description. The description is important; it's what users see in the dataset info tooltip in the datasets hub and on the dataset's details page. A description helps users quickly identify datasets that might be useful for them. See [Dataset description](/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-description) for details about how to provide a dataset description.
