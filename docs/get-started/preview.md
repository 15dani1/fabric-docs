# Microsoft Fabric preview information

This article describes the meaning of *preview* in Microsoft Fabric, and explains how preview features can be used.

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a *preview* basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Preview features:

* Are subject to separate [supplemental preview terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2240967).

* Aren't meant for production use.

* Are not subject to SLAs and support is provided as best effort in certain cases. However, Microsoft Support is eager to get your feedback on the preview functionality, and might provide best effort support in certain cases.

* May have limited or restricted functionality.

* May be available only in selected geographic areas.
