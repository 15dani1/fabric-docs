# Give users access to workspaces

After you [create a workspace](create-workspaces.md) in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)], or if you have an admin role in a workspace, you can give others access to it by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. For an explanation of the different roles, see [Roles in workspaces](roles-workspaces.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] Pro users who browse content in a workspace, assign them the Viewer Role.
> 
> After you add or remove a user or a group for workspace access, the permission change only takes effect the next time the user logs into [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)].

## Give access to your workspace

1. Because you have the Admin role in the workspace, on the workspace content list page, you see **Access**.

1. Add security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers.
