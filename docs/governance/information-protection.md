# Information protection in Microsoft Fabric

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Microsoft Fabric information protection provides capabilities that enable you to classify, protect, and monitor your organization’s sensitive data. With Fabric’s information protection capabilities, sensitive data remains safe end-to-end, from the time it enters Fabric from data sources to when it leaves Fabric via supported export paths.

Information protection in Microsoft Fabric leverages sensitivity labels to from Microsoft Purview Information Protection. Once your sensitive data is labeled, you can monitor and analyze it, either in Fabric's Microsoft Purview hub, or in the Purview portal itself. Purview’s powerful analytic capabilities enable you to get a detailed, comprehensive picture of the state of your organization’s sensitive data, and to drill down into details to obtain actionable insights.

This article describes Fabric's information protection capabilities, outlines the steps you need to take to implement information protection in your organization, and provides links to relevant documentation.

>[!NOTE]
> Information protection in Fabric is based on information protection in Power BI. Currently, information protection in Fabric is more fully supported for Power BI items than other Fabric items. Information protection in Power BI has additional capabilities, many of which will be coming to Fabric in the months ahead.

## Capabilities

The following table summarizes the information protection capabilities in Fabric that help you achieve maximum coverage of the sensitive information in your organization.

|Capability|Scenario|Public preview support|
|:----------|:---------|:----------|
|Manual labeling|Users can manually apply sensitive labels to Fabric items|Supported for all Fabric items.|
|Default labeling creation|When a new item is created, it gets a default sensitivity label unless a label is applied through other means.|Supported for all Fabric items, with limitation. When there is a clear substantive create dialog. experienceNot |
|Default labeling update scenario|If an article doesn’t have an artifact, label gets applied.|Limitaitons: Power BI – change to any other attricbuts, will get applied. Fabric – only certain attributes. name, description, etc. And through flyout. workload editing: making a change to a item in the workload interface – not supported currently.|
|Mandatory labeling|Users can’t save items unless a sensitivity label is applied to the item. Can’t remove label either.|Currently supported for Power BI items only. Not enforced in Flyout Lakehouse, Pipeline: if mandatory is on, and default is off. And MIP enabled. Data Warehouse – same show label section thorugh dialog.|
|Programmatic labeling|Sensitivity labels can be added, changed, or deleted programmatically via Power BI admin REST APIs.|Supported for all Fabric items.|
|Downstream inheritance|When a sensitivity label is applied to an item, the label is propagated down to all dependent items. For example, when a label is applied to a Power BI dataset, that label will filter down and be applied to reports and dashboards that are based on the dataset. |Supported for all Fabric items. Limitation: a label set on a dataset will not propagate downstream to non-Power BI Fabric items. PBI->PBI support FR->FB support FR->PBI support Pbi->FB not supported today. Lakehouse : Data Warehouse autogenerated items get label of the Lakehouse or data warehouse t |
|Inheritance upon creation|When you create new item by copying an existing one, the new item will take the label of the existing item.| Supported for all Fabric items (with limitations?) Pipeline, Notebook. If you try to create from lakehouse, it will get the lakehouse label (Notebook, from Lakehouse?)|
|Inheritance from data sources|When a Fabric item ingests data from a data source that has a sensitivity label, that label is applied to the Fabric item. The label then filters down to the child items of that Fabric item via downstream inheritance.|Currently supported for PBI datasets only.|
|Export|When a user exports data from an item that has a sensitivity label, the sensitivity label will move with it to the exported format. |Currently supported for Power BI items in supported export paths. Fabric- no workload works with the new export method. PuPr when export a warning is issued. |
