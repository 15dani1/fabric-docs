# The Microsoft Purview Hub in Microsoft Fabric

The Microsoft Purview hub is your gateway to Microsoft Purview's powerful governance and compliance capabilities. It provides Purview insights about your Fabric data estate, as well as entry points to the Microsoft Purview unified portal itself where you can gain wider insights, not only about your Microsoft Fabric environment, but about your whole data estate. It also provides links to documentation to help you get started implementing Purview governance and compliance capabilities in your organization.

## Accessing the hub

To access the hub, select the Fabric settings gear icon and choose **Microsoft Purview hub (preview)**.
