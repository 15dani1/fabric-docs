# Use Microsoft Purview to govern Microsoft Fabric

With Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft Purview together you're able to govern your entire estate and entire lineage of data. From data source down to the Power BI report.
Discover your Fabric artifacts with no additional Purview RBAC required!

## What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a family of data governance, risk, and compliance solutions that can help your organization govern, protect, and manage your entire data estate. Microsoft Purview solutions provide integrated coverage and help address the recent increases in remote user connectivity, the fragmentation of data across organizations, and the blurring of traditional IT management roles.

Discover, understand, manage, and share high quality data. Protect sensitive data across clouds, apps, and devices. Identify data risks and manage regulatory compliance requirements. Prevent unauthorized or accidental sharing, transfer, or use of sensitive data.

## Microsoft Purview and Fabric together

Fabric users can achieve compliance management using the Microsoft Purview portal. Users can discover assets across your hybrid data estate. You can annotate those assets with business context to aid in discovery and understanding, and you can gain data source and annotation insights.

## Microsoft Purview Hub

Microsoft Purview insights about your Fabric artifacts inside Fabric! A gateway to Microsoft Purview where you can go to see extended/enhanced Purview insights and explore the rest of your data estate.

## Microsoft Purview Information Protection

Know and protect your sensitive data by classify and label your data at scale. Encrypt your data at rest, in transit, and in use.

## Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention

Automatically enforce compliance with regulations and internal policies across cloud and on-premises assets. Extend DLP policy to both Microsoft and non-Microsoft endpoints, on premises file shares, user apps, browsers, and services. Apply flexible policy administration to balance user productivity.

## Microsoft Purview Audit

Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium) helps organizations to conduct forensic and compliance investigations by increasing audit log retention required to conduct an investigation, providing access to crucial events (by using Audit log search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal and the Office 365 Management Activity API) that help determine scope of compromise, and faster access to Office 365 Management Activity API.

## Microsoft Purview Data Catalog

With the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, business and technical users can quickly and easily find relevant data using a search experience with filters based on lenses such as glossary terms, classifications, sensitivity labels and more. For subject matter experts, data stewards and officers, the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog provides data curation features such as business glossary management and the ability to automate tagging of data assets with glossary terms. Data consumers and producers can also visually trace the lineage of data assets: for example, starting from operational systems on-premises, through movement, transformation & enrichment with various data storage and processing systems in the cloud, to consumption in an analytics system like Power BI.
