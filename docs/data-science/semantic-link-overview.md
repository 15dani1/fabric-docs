# Overview of Semantic Link

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

This document provides an overview of the Semantic Link feature.

## Prerequisites

## Overview

Semantic Link establishes a connection between Power BI datasets and the Data Science workload.
The feature aims to provide data connectivity, propagation of semantic information and seemless integration with established tools used by data scientists.
You can preserve subject matter expertsâ€™ knowledge about data semantics in a standardized form to help make the analysis faster and with less errors.

Power BI datasets act as the single semantic model and the source of truth for semantic definitions, such as Power BI measures.

Semantic Link supports data connectivity to the Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) ecosystem through the SemPy Python library.

Data scientist more familiar with the [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) ecosystem can gain access to Power BI datasets through the Semantic Link Spark native connector.
The implementation enables a wide variety of languages: PySpark, Spark SQL, R and Scala.

Furthermore, Semantic Link implements [semantic propagation](./semantic-link-powerbi.md#semantic-propagation) to enable downstream task such as [measure-join](./semantic-link-powerbi.md#measure-join) and intelligent suggestion of built-in [semantic functions](./semantic-link-powerbi.md#semantic-functions). It does so by maintaining metadata across data transformations.
