Understanding and modeling of the data: SemPy capabilities for for automatic discovery and visualization of relationships between entities can help you understand the underlying structure of the data. It is also a tool for data scientists to collaborate with each other, data engineers, and PowerBI analysts that empowers sharing and storing of semantic knowledge.
