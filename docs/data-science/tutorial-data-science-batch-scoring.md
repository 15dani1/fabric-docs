# Module 5: Perform batch scoring and save predictions to a lakehouse

In this module, you learn to import a trained and registered LightGBMRegressor model from the Microsoft Fabric MLflow model registry, and perform batch predictions on a test dataset loaded from a lakehouse.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Follow along in notebook

The python commands/script used in each step of this tutorial can be found in the accompanying notebook: [05-perform-batch-scoring-and-save-predictions-to-lakehouse.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-samples/blob/main/docs-samples/data-science/data-science-tutorial/05-perform-batch-scoring-and-save-predictions-to-lakehouse.ipynb). Be sure to [attach a lakehouse to the notebook](tutorial-data-science-prepare-system.md#attach-a-lakehouse-to-the-notebooks) before executing it.

## Perform batch scoring and save predictions

1. Read a random sample of cleansed data from lakehouse table ***nyctaxi_prep*** filtered for puYear=2016 and puMonth=3.

1. Import the required pyspark.ml and synapse.ml libraries and load the trained and registered LightGBMRegressor model using the ***run_uri*** copied from the final step of [Module 4: Train and register machine learning models](tutorial-data-science-train-models.md).

1. Run model transform on the input dataframe to generate predictions and remove unnecessary vector features created for model training using the following commands.

1. Save predictions to lakehouse delta table **nyctaxi_pred** for downstream consumption and analysis.

1. Preview the final predicted data by various methods including SparkSQL queries that can be executed using the %%sql magics command, which tells the notebook engine that the cell is a SparkSQL script.

1. The **nyctaxi_pred** delta table containing predictions can also be viewed from the lakehouse UI by navigating to the lakehouse artifact in the active Fabric workspace.
