# Autologging in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [product-name](../data-science/includes/fabric-ds-name.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] includes autologging, which significantly reduces the amount of code required to automatically log the parameters, metrics, and artifacts of a machine learning model during training. This feature extends [MLflow autologging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging) capabilities and is deeply integrated into the [!INCLUDE [product-name](../data-science/includes/fabric-ds-name.md)] in [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] experience. Using autologging, developers and data scientists can easily track and compare the performance of different models and experiments without the need for manual tracking.

## How it works

Autologging works by automatically capturing the values of input parameters, output metrics, and output artifacts of a machine learning model as it is being trained. This information is then logged to your [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] workspace, where it can be accessed and visualized using the MLFlow APIs or the corresponding experiment & model artifacts in your [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] workspace.

The default configuration for the notebook [mlflow.auotolog()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog) hook is:

```python
mlflow.autolog(
    log_input_examples=False,
    log_model_signatures=True,
    log_models=True,
    disable=False,
    exclusive=True,
    disable_for_unsupported_versions=True,
    silent=True
)
```

When you launch a [!INCLUDE [product-name](../data-science/includes/fabric-ds-name.md)] notebook, [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] calls [mlflow.autolog()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog) to instantly enable the tracking and load the corresponding dependencies. As you train models in your notebook, this model information is automatically tracked with MLflow. This configuration is done automatically behind the scenes when you run ```import mlflow```.

### Supported frameworks

Autologging supports a wide range of machine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. It can capture a variety of metrics, including accuracy, loss, and F1 score, as well as custom metrics defined by the user. To learn more about the framework specific properties that are captured, you can visit [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging).

## Customize logging behavior

To customize the logging behavior, you can use the [mlflow.autolog()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog) configuration. This configuration provides the parameters to enable model logging, collect input samples, configure warnings, or even enable logging for user-specified content.

### Track additional content

You can update the autologging configuration to track additional metrics, parameters, files, and metadata with runs created with MLflow. 

To do this:

1. Update the [mlflow.autolog()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog) call and set ```exclusive=False```.

    ```python
        mlflow.autolog(
        log_input_examples=False,
        log_model_signatures=True,
        log_models=True,
        disable=False,
        exclusive=False, # Update this property to enable custom logging
        disable_for_unsupported_versions=True,
        silent=True
    )
    ```

2. Use the MLflow tracking APIs to log additional [parameters](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_param) and [metrics](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_metric). This allows you to capture your custom metrics and parameters, while also allowing you to use autologging to capture additional properties.

    For instance:
    ```python
    import mlflow
    mlflow.autolog(exclusive=False)

    with mlflow.start_run():
      mlflow.log_param("parameter name", "example value")
      # <add model training code here>
      mlflow.log_metric("metric name", 20)
    ```

### Disable [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] autologging

[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] autologging can be disabled for a specific notebook session or across all notebooks using the workspace setting.

>[!NOTE]
> If autologging is disabled, users must manually log their own [parameters](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_param) and [metrics](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.log_metric) using the MLflow APIs.

### Disable autologging for a notebook session

To disable [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] autologging in a notebook session, you can call [mlflow.autolog()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog) and set ```disable=True```.

For example:

```python
import mlflow
mlflow.autolog(disable=True)
```

### Disable autologging for the workspace

Workspace administrators can enable or disable [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] autologging for all sessions across their workspace.

To do this:

1. Navigate to your [!INCLUDE [product-name](../data-science/includes/fabric-ds-name.md)] workspace and select **Workspace Settings**.

2. In the **Data Engineering/Science** tab, select **Spark compute**. Here, you will find the setting to enable or disable [!INCLUDE [product-name](../data-science/includes/fabric-ds-name.md)] autologging.
