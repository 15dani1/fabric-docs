# Semantic Propagation

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Semantic propagation keeps metadata associated through out data manipulation to enable downstream operations.

Metadata includes: Power BI data source, relationships, data categories and hierarchies.

TODO: what operations do we support?

TODO: what rules do we follow in case of conflict (e.g. concat)

TODO: what limitations?
