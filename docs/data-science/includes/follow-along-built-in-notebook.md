To open the tutorial's built-in sample notebook in the Data Science experience:

1. Go to the Data Science home page.
1. Select **Use a sample**.
1. Select the corresponding sample:

    1. From the default **End-to-end workflows (Python)** tab, if the sample is for a Python tutorial.
    1. From the **End-to-end workflows (R)** tab, if the sample is for an R tutorial.
    1. From the **Quick tutorials** tab, if the sample is for a quick tutorial.
    
1. Be sure to [attach a lakehouse to the notebook](../tutorial-data-science-prepare-system.md#attach-a-lakehouse-to-the-notebooks) before you start running code.
