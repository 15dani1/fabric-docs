Visualization capabilities: SemPy helps increase productivity by reducing the need to manually create visualizations, from relationships between tables and functional dependencies to wrappers on top of common plotting libraries that simplify EDA by providing user-friendly interfaces and hiding complex parameters.

Auto-suggestions of code: context-aware suggestions of common code snippets in SemPy reduce the need to manually type, saving time and reducing errors. This capability can help improve collaboration by driving consistency across the codebase and making it easier to understand code.
