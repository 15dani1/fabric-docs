# One logical copy (Shortcut)

In this article, you'll learn how to create a OneLake shortcut to expose the data in your KQL Database to all of [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)]'s experiences.

OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] to store lakehouses, warehouses and other items. Shortcuts are embedded references within OneLake that point to other filesâ€™ store locations.  The embedded reference makes it appear as though the files and folders are stored locally but in reality; they exist in another storage location. Shortcuts can be updated or removed from your items, but these changes don't affect the original data and its source.

[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] supports two types of OneLake shortcuts that use internal sources:

| Shortcut | Description | When to use it? |
|---------| --------- | --------- |
|External table| Defines the data from OneLake as an external table in your KQL Database. | Use this shortcut when you want to infrequently run queries on historical data without partitioning or indexing the data. To create a OneLake shortcut, see [Create a OneLake shortcut](onelake-shortcut.md). But if you want to run queries frequently and accelerate performance, import the data directly from OneLake. For direct import, see [Get data from OneLake](get-data-onelake.md).
|One logical copy| Creates one logical copy of the data in your KQL Database in OneLake. This shortcut is a two-step process that requires enabling continuous export of your data, and creating a shortcut in OneLake. | Use this shortcut if you want to access your data in other [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] experiences without more management. |

For more information on OneLake shortcuts, see [OneLake shortcuts](../onelake/onelake-shortcuts.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Power BI Premium subscription](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-purchase).
* A Workspace
* A [KQL database](create-database.md) with data.

## Continuous export

Creating one logical copy of your data in OneLake is a two-step process. You send your data from your KQL Database to OneLake by enabling continuous export, then you expose the data by creating a OneLake shortcut. To create the shortcut, see [Create shortcut](#create-shortcut).

Continuous export to OneLake is enabled in your **KQL Database** by default. If you disable continuous export before creating your Lakehouse, your data won't be sent to OneLake. If you disable continuous export after creating a Lakehouse, the data that was already sent will remain, but any data loaded into your database after that point will remain in your database.

1. To disable **Continuous export**, navigate to your **KQL Database**.
1. On the ribbon, select **Manage**.
1. Select **Continuous export** > **off**.

## Create shortcut

1. Open the experience switcher on the bottom of the navigation pane and select **Data Engineering**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/onelake-mirroring/app-switcher-data-engineering.png" alt-text="Screenshot of experience switcher showing a list of experiences. The experience titled Data Engineering is highlighted.":::

1. Select **Lakehouse**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/onelake-mirroring/new-lakehouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Data Engineering artifacts. The option titled Lakehouse is highlighted.":::

1. Name your Lakehouse, then select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/onelake-mirroring/lakehouse-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new Lakehouse window showing the Lakehouse name. The button titled Create is highlighted.":::

1. Select **New Shortcut** on the right-hand side of the Lakehouse.

    :::image type="content" source="media/onelake-mirroring/new-shortcut.png" alt-text="Screenshot of empty Lakehouse. The option titled New shortcut is highlighted.":::

1. Under **Internal sources**, select **Microsoft OneLake**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/onelake-mirroring/internal-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot of New Shortcut window. The option under Internal sources titled Microsoft OneLake is highlighted.":::

1. In **Select a data source type**, select your KQL Database, then select **Next** to connect the data to your shortcut.

    :::image type="content" source="media/onelake-mirroring/onelake-shortcut-data-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot of data source type window showing all of the data sources in your workspace. The button titled Next is highlighted.":::

1. To connect the table with the data from your database, select **>** to expand the tables in the left-hand pane, then select a table.

1. Select **Create** to create the shortcut. The Lakehouse will automatically refresh.

The Lakehouse shortcut has been created. You now have one logical copy of your data that you can use in other [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] experiences without more management.
