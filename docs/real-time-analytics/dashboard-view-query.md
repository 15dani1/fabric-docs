# View queries in Real-Time Dashboards

[Real-Time Dashboards](dashboard-real-time.md) are a collection of tiles that feature a visual representation supported by an underlying [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/index?context=/fabric/context/context-rta&pivots=fabric) query. This article explains how to view and edit the underlying query of a Real-Time Dashboard tile.

The way you view or edit the query of a tile depends on the permissions you have on the dashboard. Choose the tab that corresponds to [viewing](#viewing-modetabviewing) or [editing](#editing-modetabediting) the dashboard.

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* Viewer or editor permissions on a [Real-Time Dashboard](dashboard-real-time.md)

### [Viewing mode](#tab/viewing)

Text  1


### [Editing mode](#tab/editing)

Text 2
