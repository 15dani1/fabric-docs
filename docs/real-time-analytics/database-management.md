# Database management

To manage your data, select **Manage** on the **home** tab of your database. You can then modify the **Data retention policy** by selecting it.

## Data retention policy

To change the data retention policy, enter a time period and select **Done**. By default, your data is stored for 36500 days.

For more information, see [Retention policy](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/retentionpolicy?context=/fabric/context/context).
