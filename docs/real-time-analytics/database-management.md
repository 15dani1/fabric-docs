# Manage

To manage your data, select **Manage** on the **home** tab.

You can modify the following database settings:

* [Data retention policy](#data-retention-policy)
* [Continuous export](#continuous-export)
* [Data connections](#data-connections)

## Data retention policy

For more information about the retention policy, see [Retention policy](#data-retention-policy).  To change the data retention policy, enter a time period and select **Done**. By default, your data is stored for 36500 days.

## Continuous export

To enable continuous data export, you need to have database admin permissions.

## Data connections

The **Data connections** pane opens to show available connections to Azure Event Hubs. To establish a new cloud data connection, see [Create a data connection](get-data-event-hub.md#create-a-data-stream).
