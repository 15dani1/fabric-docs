# Create a database

In Real-Time Analytics, you'll interact with your data in the context of databases. A single workspace can hold multiple databases, and each database can hold multiple tables.

In this article, you learn you how to create a new database. Once your database has data, you can proceed to query your data using Kusto Query Language in a KQL queryset.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../get-started/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)

## Create a new database

1. Select **New** > **KQL Database**.

1. Enter your database name, then select **Create**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The database name can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Special characters aren't supported.

The KQL Database has now been created within the context of the selected workspace.

## Database details

The main page of your database shows an overview of the contents in your database. The following table lists the information you'll see.
