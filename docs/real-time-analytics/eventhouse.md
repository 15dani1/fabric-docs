# Eventhouse overview (Preview)

In Real-Time Analytics, you interact with your data in the context of Eventhouses, databases, and tables. A single workspace can hold multiple Eventhouses, an Eventhouse can hold multiple databases, and each database can hold multiple tables. 

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

An Eventhouse allows you to manage multiple databases at once, sharing capacity and resources to optimize performance and cost. It provides unified monitoring and management across all databases and per database.

While Eventhouse is in preview, you can create a standalone [KQL database](create-database.md), or a KQL database within an Eventhouse. The KQL database can either be a standard database, or a [database shortcut](database-shortcut.md). [Data availability in OneLake](one-logical-copy.md) is still enabled on a database or table level.
