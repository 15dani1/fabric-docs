# Eventhouse (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview-note](../includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

Why does it exist?
Manage many databases in one go - sharing, permissions
Consolidate lots of small databases that are being billed at minimum

Do we want to mention that it's like ADX cluster? (I think no)

Currently while Eventhouse is in preview, you can create a standalone KQL database, or a KQL database within an Eventhouse. 

Autoscale

Region/zonality?

Can create an ADX-to-RTA database follower under the EH

Mirroring ? Right now database or table level, will probably be also eventhouse level


How it works:

Create EH by putting a name
You are brought to the database that is created simultaneously by default
