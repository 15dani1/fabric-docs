# Add and manage an event source in an eventstream

Once you have created an eventstream, you can connect it to various data sources and destinations. The types of event sources that you can add to your eventstream include Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, Sample data, and Custom app.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](../../includes/preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Get access to a **premium workspace** with **Contributor** or above permissions where your eventstream is located.
- To add an Azure Event Hubs or Azure IoT Hub as eventstream source, you need to have appropriate permission to access its policy keys. They must be publicly accessible and not behind a firewall or secured in a virtual network.

## Supported sources

The following sources are supported by Fabric Eventstream:

| Sources          | Description |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Azure Event Hubs | If you have an Azure event hub, you can ingest event hub data into Microsoft Fabric using Eventstream.  |
| Azure IoT Hub | If you have an Azure IoT hub, you can ingest IoT data into Microsoft Fabric using Eventstream.  |
| Sample data | You can choose **Bicycles**, **Yellow Taxi** or **Stock Market events** as a sample data source to test the data ingestion while setting up an eventstream. |
| Custom App | The custom app feature allows your applications or Kafka clients to connect to Eventstream using a connection string, enabling the smooth ingestion of streaming data into Eventstream. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The total count of sources and destinations for one eventstream is **11**.
> - Event data retention in an eventstream is **1 day**, with the potential to extend it and make it configurable in the future.

## Add an Azure event hub as a source

If you have an Azure event hub created with streaming data, follow these steps to add an Azure event hub as your eventstream source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Azure Event Hubs**.

## Add a sample data as a source

To get a better understanding of how an eventstream works, you can use the out-of-box sample data provided and send data to the eventstream. Follow these steps to add a sample data source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Sample data**.

1. On the right pane, enter a source name to appear on the canvas, select the sample data you want to add to your eventstream, and then select **Add**.
   - **Bicycles**: sample bicycles data with a preset schema that includes fields such as BikepointID, Street, Neighbourhood, Latitude, and more.
   - **Yellow Taxi**: sample taxi data with a preset schema that includes fields such as pickup time, drop-off time, distance, total fee, and more.
   - **Stock Market**: sample data of a stock exchange with a preset schema column such as time, symbol, price, volume and more.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-sample-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sample data source configuration." lightbox="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-sample-data.png":::

1. When the sample data source is added successfully, you can find it on the canvas and navigation pane.

To verify if the sample data is added successfully, select **Data preview** in the bottom pane.

## Add custom application as a source

If you want to connect your own application with an eventstream, you can add a custom app source. Then, send data to the eventstream with your own application with the connection endpoint exposed in the custom app. Follow these steps to add a custom app source:

1. Select **New source** on the ribbon or "**+**" in the main editor canvas and then **Custom App**.

1. Enter a **Source name** for the custom app and select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-streams-source\eventstream-sources-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app source configuration." lightbox="./media/event-streams-source/eventstream-sources-custom-app.png":::

1. After you have successfully created the custom application source, you can switch and view the following information in the **Details** tab in the lower pane:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app source." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source.png":::

   - **Basic**: Shows the name, description, type and status of your custom app.
   - **Keys**: Shows the connection string for your custom app, which you can copy and paste into your application.
   - **Sample code**: Shows sample code, which you can refer to or copy to push the event data to this eventstream or pull the event data from this eventstram.

   For each tab (**Basic** / **Keys** / **Sample code**), you can also switch three protocol tabs: Eventhub, AMQP and Kafka to access diverse protocol formats information:

   The connection string is an event hub compatible connection string, and you can use it in your application to receive events from your eventstream. The connection string has multiple protocol formats, which you can switch and select in the Keys tab. The following example shows what the connection string looks like in Eventhub format:

   *`Endpoint=sb://eventstream-xxxxxxxx.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=key_xxxxxxxx;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxx;EntityPath=es_xxxxxxxx`*

      The EventHub format is the default format for the connection string, and it is compatible with the Azure Event Hubs SDK. You can use this format to connect to eventstream using the Event Hubs protocol.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom app details." lightbox="./media/add-manage-eventstream-sources/custom-app-source-detail.png":::

      The other two protocol formats are AMQP and Kafka, which you can select by clicking on the corresponding tabs in the Keys tab.

      The AMQP format is compatible with the AMQP 1.0 protocol, which is a standard messaging protocol that supports interoperability between different platforms and languages. You can use this format to connect to eventstream using the AMQP protocol.

      The Kafka format is compatible with the Apache Kafka protocol, which is a popular distributed streaming platform that supports high-throughput and low-latency data processing. You can use this format to connect to eventstream using the Kafka protocol.

   You can choose the protocol format that suits your application needs and preferences, and copy and paste the connection string into your application. You can also refer to or copy the sample code that we provide in the Sample code tab, which shows how to send or receive events using different protocols.

## Manage source

- **Edit/remove**: You can select an eventstream source to edit or remove either through the navigation pane or canvas. When you select **Edit**, the edit pane opens in the right of the main editor.
