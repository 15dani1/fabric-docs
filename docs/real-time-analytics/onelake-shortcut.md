# Create a OneLake shortcut

OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] to store lakehouses, warehouses and other items.

Shortcuts are embedded references within OneLake that point to other filesâ€™ storage locations. The embedded reference makes it appear as though the files and folders are stored locally but in reality; they exist in another storage location.

Shortcuts can be updated or removed from your items, but these changes won't affect the original data and its source.

There are two types of shortcuts:

* OneLake shortcut linking your KQL Database to OneLake. This shortcut creates one logical copy of the data in your database that you can access in other [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] experiences without more management.

* OneLake shortcut linking data in OneLake to your KQL Database. This shortcut references data from OneLake as an external table. It's useful for querying large amounts of data that you don't want to store locally.

In this article, you'll learn how to create a OneLake shortcut in the context of your KQL Database.

## Prerequisites

* Power BI Premium subscription. For more information, see [How to purchase Power BI Premium](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-purchase).
