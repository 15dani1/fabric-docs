# Create an external table (shortcut)

In this article, you'll learn how to create a OneLake shortcut to reference data from OneLake in your KQL Database.

OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] to store lakehouses, warehouses and other items. Shortcuts are embedded references within OneLake that point to other filesâ€™ store locations. The embedded reference makes it appear as though the files and folders are stored locally but in reality; they exist in another storage location. Shortcuts can be updated or removed from your items, but these changes don't affect the original data and its source.

[!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] supports two types of OneLake shortcuts that use internal sources:

| Shortcut | Description | When to use it? |
|---------| --------- | --------- |
|External table| Defines the data from OneLake as an external table in your KQL Database. | Use this shortcut when you want to infrequently run queries on historical data without partitioning or indexing the data. But if you want to run queries frequently and accelerate performance, import the data directly from OneLake. For direct import, see [Get data from OneLake](get-data-onelake.md).
|One logical copy| Creates one logical copy of the data in your KQL Database in OneLake. This shortcut is a two-step process that requires enabling continuous export of your data, and creating a shortcut in OneLake. | Use this shortcut if you want to access your data in other [!INCLUDE [product-name](../includes/product-name.md)] experiences without more management. To create one logical copy, see <!-- [One logical copy (shortcut)](onelake-mirroring) --->|

For more information on OneLake shortcuts, see [OneLake shortcuts](../onelake/onelake-shortcuts.md).
