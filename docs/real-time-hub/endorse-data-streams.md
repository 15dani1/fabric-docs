# Endorse streams in Fabric Real-Time hub
Organizations often have large numbers of Microsoft Fabric items available for sharing and reuse by their Fabric users. It can be difficult to identify trustworthy and authoritative items. Endorsement is a way to make it easier for users to find the high-quality items they need. For more information, see [Endorsement in Fabric](../get-started/endorsement-promote-certify.md).  

You can endorse a stream from one of the following pages:

- Data streams tab of the Real-Time hub
- Stream details page of a stream

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](./includes/preview-note.md)]

## From data streams page

You can endorse data in a data stream using the following steps:

1. Move the mouse over the stream in the list, select ... (ellipsis)
1. Select **Endorse**.

    This screenshot is for a stream whose parent is an eventstream. You see the same **Endorse** option for a KQL table too. 

## From stream details page

1. Select a stream in the **Data streams** tab of the **Real-Time hub**.
1. On the stream details page, select the **Endorse** button as shown in the following image.
