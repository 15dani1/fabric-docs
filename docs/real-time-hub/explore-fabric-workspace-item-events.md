# Explore Fabric workspace item events in Fabric Real-Time hub
Real-Time hub expands Fabric with event-driven capabilities to support real-time data processing and analysis. This feature enables event-driven scenarios for various system events, including Fabric workspace item events and Azure blob storage events. By using System events in Fabric, you can gain access to real-time data streams that enable them to monitor and react to changes and events as they occur. 

Fabric workspace item events allow you to receive notification when certain actions occur on your workspace items, such as when a new artifact is created, or an existing artifact is deleted. These events can be used to alert on other actions or workflows in Fabric, such as running a data pipeline or sending an email notification using Data Activator alerting capabilities. This article explains how to explore Fabric workspace item events in Real-Time hub.

## View Azure blob storage events detail page

1. In **Real-Time hub**, switch to the **Fabric events** tab. 
1. Select **Fabric workspace item events** in the list. You should see the detail view for Fabric workspace item events. 

## Actions
At the top of the detail page, you see the following two actions.

- **Create eventstream** - lets you create an eventstream based on events from the selected Fabric workspace item. 
- **Set alert** - lets you set an alert when an operation is done for a Fabric workspace item, such as a new artifact is created.
